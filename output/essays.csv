Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Personally, I agree with the statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 
However, I do not think that this statement is completely correct. I have to admit that there are several companies advertising their products in an honest way, stating only facts about the product without any misleading slogans or jingles.
On the other hand, the majority of today\s industries is clever enough to trick their customers into buying their products. They do so by either creating highly convincing advertisemetns with slogans or jingles people tend to associate with the product, or they claim characteristics and facts about the products that are simply untrue. The most effective advertising strategy next to an easy to remember jingle you cannot get out of your head  is advertising with the support of celebrities presenting the product. 
Even though I do not like the idea of being lied to by a company, I can certainly understand this marketing mentality that is so widely spread today. In a world of globalization, open borders and free markets, every market of every country is flooded with an increadibly high number of foreign products. Not only do foreign products mostly seem more attractive to customers, they are often  cheap copies of orginals invented and produced in the home country.  Monoplies hardly ever exist anymore and competing not only with other companies in the country but especially with foreign companies certainly is rough. 
However, I think companies should only try to manipulate customers to a certain extent. There should be a clear difference between lying completely and persuading and influecing a little. Being a customer myself, of course, I rely on the government to control marketing strategies on the one hand but I definitely rely on own experiences I make on the other hand. If I know about a product that it does not fulfill all the expectations the company made me believe in, I will try my best to convince others not to buy it and I hope others will do so as well. And even if companies tend at times to overestimate a little and seem to be too euphemistic about their products, we still live in a world where people have gotten used to this kind of advertising behavior by now. I think, there is only a small percentage of society left that truly believes all the statements made in advertisement.

../alldata/training/essays/1109085.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"People often argue about what is more important for students to learn: ideas and concepts; or facts. Based on my four years of experience as a teacher, I strongly believe that it is far more important for students to learn ideas and concepts. Facts change very quickly, whereas ideas and concepts remain useful for a lifetime.

One of the most important objectives of education is to prepare the students for their future careers. I believe that students who understand the ideas and concepts well have a much better chance to succeed in the future than those who simply learn facts. This is especially evident in disciplines like science and engineering, where there is very little that one can do by simply memorizing facts. A student who only learns the basic equations about electricity can not  solve problems that involve combining various concepts or ideas. It is far more important for the student to understand the fundamental concepts and ideas, and develop an ability to make use of these concepts to develop his or her own solutions to practical problems. Similary, in history, it is a lot more important to understand the context of a war, rather than learn the simple fact that the war took place in a certain year. For example, it would be a lot more useful to understand why and how Hitler came to power in Germany, rather than the dates of particular events. 

Another factor that illustrates  the relative importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts is also evident from the rate at which facts are changing. The rapid developments in science and technology change the so-called facts at such a high speed that it does not make sense for a student to spend too much time on learning facts. As a teacher, I often notice that many text-books that I have begun to use for my classes only a few years ago have already become out of date! Ideas and concepts, on the other hand continue to be valid over much longer periods of time. Moreover, in many cases, it is even possible for the students to apply a concept they learned in one area to some other areas. Facts, on the other hand, can not be easily transferred from one area to another.","People often argue about what is more important for students to learn: ideas and concepts; or facts.

Another factor that illustrates  the relative importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts is also evident from the rate at which facts are changing.

The rapid developments in science and technology change the so-called facts at such a high speed that it does not make sense for a student to spend too much time on learning facts.

As a teacher, I often notice that many text-books that I have begun to use for my classes only a few years ago have already become out of date!

Ideas and concepts, on the other hand continue to be valid over much longer periods of time.

Moreover, in many cases, it is even possible for the students to apply a concept they learned in one area to some other areas.

Facts, on the other hand, can not be easily transferred from one area to another.","People/NNS often/RB argue/VBP about/IN what/WP is/VBZ more/RBR important/JJ for/IN students/NNS to/TO learn/VB :/: ideas/NNS and/CC concepts/NNS ;/: or/CC facts/NNS ./.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I concede that in some respects, the young should contribute to their communities more in which they live in. However, beyond this concession, because of the new technology, the young are beginning to help their communities in some nations.Therefore, on balance, I do not agree with the statement.
     Admittedly, at a first glance, they do not give much time to help their community. This is especially true when it comes to developed countries. Compared with the decades ago, young people are required to study hard because they have to master more and more diverse skills including informaiton technology. In my observation, due to the time required to learn these skills, they do not have much enough time to contribute to their community.
     Nevetheless, the statement overlooks some positive changes that the young people have experienced. Thanks to the advent of the information technology, more and more young people help their communities using the technology. For example,  a number of young people used the technology to support humanitalian projects in many communities. The young in Japan supported the people who lost their houses because of a massive eathquake by calling for the financial support on the Internet. Thus, they can and do use the technology to solve local problems.
     It would be tempting to argue that the young are not interested in their community considering their apathy in politics in some nations. However, the statement overstates the situation of such nations. When it comes to nations where political situations are not stable, the young are forced to participate in their communities. For instance, we do not have to look no further than Taiwan. Because of their severe condition in which the pressure from Beijing is massive, the young are serious about their future and their nation. Thus, the statement unfairly ignores such young people. 
     In sum, because of their difficulties, many young people do not have much time to helping their communities; however, the advent of the informaiton technology made it possible for them to participate in the community in new ways.

../alldata/training/essays/1392946.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Nowadays a lot of people like to take riks and test their own limit. Everybode tries to hone their abillities. Some argue that this way of life is just limited to successful people, because they achieved nearly everything else . On the one hand, the successful people explore new things and have less concern about risks. But on the other hand, I think, that these features are not just traits of successful people, rather a typical human behavior like eating.
The need for certain risks, new expieriences and to be good at something is part of everyones way of life.

First, risks is often connected to the hormon adrenaline. If a person is in a dangerous situation his or her adrenaline level increases. This is often assiciated with a drug or the feeling to be alive. Successful people may have a greater need, because of their prior accomplishments, but this feeling and the hormon is common to every human being.

Second, the desire to try out new things and gain new expieriences is common to everyone. For examples, young children explore their surroundings and they find mostly great joy in it. This behaviour has obviously nothing to do with success.

Third, we live in a highly specialized world and nobody is able to be good at everything. Successful people, to my mind, have specialized in one trait to be successful. To learn another skill may lessen their ability to be good at their prime skill or at work. I study electrical engineering and i have to specialize to recieve an adequate education. Without the proper education I will not be able to find a job and because of this I will not be successful.

In conclusion, you can say that there may be a stronger appeal for successful people to experiment with new things, but the main ideas are merely human. The successful will not experiment extensively, because they will use the etch that made them successful.","Nowadays a lot of people like to take riks and test their own limit.

Changes in propellants, road conditions, and a growing population can disagree in single points of views, but mostly suggest an increase in the number of cars.

Scientists, governments, and car manufacturers are in the process of developing and improving engines using alternative propellants. These propellants include gas, hydrogen, or electricity, but are not limited to those. This development can cause a smaller dependency on oil. If this is true twenty years from now, people might have switched to those alternative propellants and do not see the necessity to get rid of a car in general.

Arguments saying that the number of cars will decrease include facts like congested roads because of a growing population or a decreasing quality of road conditions. In addition some people claim and favor the usage of public transportation. I assume the behavior of people will not be changed in a recognizable amount. In a large city as I am living in both previously mentioned facts are true. Cars are though used in an increasing number. For many people the car still has more advantages than public transportation. As prices for public transportation also increase attitudes about this issue are unlikely to change twenty years from now.

As mentioned before, population is increasing. Personally I am familiar with the Orlando, FL area. Throughout the past five years an incredible extension of the metropolitan area could be observed. I suppose that an increasing population causes areas to grow - making distances longer. This again can probably not be compensated by public transportation. People will continue to use cars. As far as I have experienced people mostly favor individual transportation in their cars rather than in crouded buses and trains. I doubt a chance in the future.

Responses of urban and rural areas might also differ in response to this issue and must not be neglected. Generally I conclude a tendency to an increasing number of cars based on personal experience.","In my opinion the usage of cars will stay at a steady level, rather increase.

../alldata/training/essays/1449555.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"The issue at hand is whether advertisements make products seem better than they really are or not. This is a very important issue, because advertisements have a great influence on our every day life.
In my opinion advertisments assume products to be better than they really are.

For this I have several reasons. The first is that I experienced how advertisements can lie in my own life. I saw a new hair shampoo at the TV, which should make my hair more shiny and easier to form. Because of this advertisment I went to the shop and bought the shampoo. Maybe my hair was shinier after using the shampoo, but it was not easy to model it at all. In reality it was even more difficult. This is one of the examples which made me casting doubt on advertisements. Now I always question what is shown.

Another reason is that I compare what I see in the advertisements with the things I can buy at the shops. Through this it is obvious that the advertisments are lies. Everything looks so colorful at the TV but in reality it is not colorful at all. It is just like every other product you can buy in the shop, which is not advertised.

Finally, one can sometimes see how advertisements are produced. That completely convinces one that advertisments make products seeming better than they are. Take for example some sort of food. When people want to advertise such products they have special strategies for it. The most interesting is that most times the food is not real. Advertisers just put it together with artificial materials. So it looks better and you just want to buy it. You will never find products in advertisments in their original way. That is a big lie to the customers, is it not?

To sum up, I think that advertisements make products better than they really are because of my own experience, compares between advertised products and the actual products in the shops  and because of the way advertisements are produced.","The issue at hand is whether advertisements make products seem better than they really are or not.

For example, a Biology student who is doing a research in the field of microrganisms can go ahead with his research only if he has the basic idea of microorganisms and their behaivour. By only learning facts, he cannot reach a final decision. To have his findings more a  solid basis, he needs to have a strong foothold in microorganic study.

Similar factors work with students who have just joined school or the ones who are in the process of a learning new subject. For instance, a mathematics student can do his high level arithmetic and algebra only if his lower level maths skills are developed. Furthermore, these skills become an inherent quality when he knows how to derive at a formula.

Since the question states that not all advertisements, but most of them are making a product look much better than it really is, I am just going to give some examples in order to empiricly prove that the given statement is correct.
In that order my first example is the Mc Donalds french fries.
When you see their commercial on TV, where it is these tasty french fries just shouting out of that shimmering red box, they always look just fabulous.

As these to examples perfectly show advertisements usually make a product seem much better than it really is, which is nothing to wonder about if one looks at the purpose of an advertisement.

../alldata/training/essays/1723586.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"The issue of traveling with a tour guide is a controversial one. Some people find it to be beneficial, and more informative while others think that traveling on their own is more challenging.
I , however believe that traveling with a group guide is better. The reasons for my belief are the following:

First, traveling with a tour guide is more informative, since the guide has all the information about the place, and should be able to answer any question. He has also visited the place many times, and knows all the interesting places to be seen. I think that a person traveling with a tour guide will gain much more inforamtion and knowledge about a country's culture, than if he was to travel by himself. I have travelled with a tour guide once to Turkey, and although it was a tiring trip because the schedule was full, I got to know most of the turkish culture. One of the things I won't forget, is when we visited a play about the old traditional turkish wedding. It was a very interesting thing to see.

Second, the tour guide usually has a schedule for his group. In this schedule the group gets to see the most important, famous, and interesting places in the country being visited, probably a person visiting the country on his own would not have been aware of, or could not have planned such a schedule.  I find the time schedule to be my ultimate reason to choose a tour guide. Another reason, is the financial reason, usually tour guides have special deals with hotels or resturants since they bring them customers.

Third, I believe that traveling with a tour guide who knows the country, and traveling with a group of people is much safer than traveling alone. When visiting a new place, a person does not know the safe places, or what time is a good time to walk in a certain neighborhood. These details, which are of great importance, are taken care of by the tour guide.

For all of the reasons, I mentioned above I believe that it is a much safer, and more interesting experience to travel with a tour guide, if of course traveling to a country for the first time.","The issue of traveling with a tour guide is a controversial one.

../alldata/training/essays/1728162.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Swamped with commercials and advertisments in our daily lives, one might wonder whether a product's quality really correspond to the one being put forward by the ad or promotion. Although legally, companies can be held responsible for false advertisment, I believe that most of the sales and marketing campaigns for products do not reflect the real character of the product in question.

First of all, the praised outcomes of for instance cleaning products, can be questioned, as they deem to be very little effective for the actual purpose. Spot removal products are particularly known for this. Although  TV commercials highly recommend their use, real-life results tend to be rather frustrating. An ink spot or tomato sauce stain on your favorite yellow summer dress resists despite your desperate attempts of removing it with the highly suggested product. Unfortunately, one cannot blame the company, as the small print on the product usually allows for many loopholes regarding the interpretation of a product's effectiveness.

Furthermore, ad-campaigns, especially on TV or in the movie theatres, incite the viewers to step into a dreamland and do not reflect reality. By presenting a product, such as a Sports Utility Vehicule (SUV), as indestructable, indefeatable and magnificant, it may trigger hidden desires in potential customers. Yet, it is not important whether the product will be able to fulfill all the advertised qualities. In other words, the consumer, who will end up purchasing the item,  will most likely not need all the functions (e.g. four-wheeling) if the SUV is being used in an urban setting only. Nonetheless, it is important for the sake of the customer to maintain that dream alive.

Another argument, which supports my hypothesis is related to weight-watching products. It might be true that a person is able to lose a great amount of weight within the promoted time frame; however, this is rather a transient result. In fact, most of the time, customers who tried such products before, have found themselves with twice the weight they had before. Thus, the ad was only meant to effect short-term outcomes, rather than long-term related results.

In sum, the problem which advertisements are facing is a ""catch 22"". While they need to promote and even enhance the qualities and capacities of a product in order to incite consumers to buy it, they tend to exaggerate and paint an inaccurate picture of its real skills, which can lead to frustrating consumer experiences.","Swamped with commercials and advertisments in our daily lives, one might wonder whether a product's quality really correspond to the one being put forward by the ad or promotion.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"There is a famous saying which reads: ""Give a hungry man a fish and he will be full for the day, give him a fishing rod and he will be full for the rest of his days."" I strongly agree with what the proverb says and furthermore I believe the same logic applies in this case, as well. The understanding of the ideas and concepts is just like the rod, whereas the facts are the fish that last only a day.
    I believe that an ideal education should equip students with the necessary techniques and concepts to tackle any problem as opposed to the specific solutions for the problems only covered in classes. This enables students to deal with a much wider array of problems as they learn a general recipe of problem solving compared to a case specific approach.
    One great example from contemporary education would be history classes. If facts were more important, then all a student would need to learn would be the years of certain events. However, I believe, and the statement asserts, that the motivations and consequences in a specific historic event should be studied more than the facts and dates. Rather than memorizing the year of a battle, an ideal history course should concentrate on the succession of the events that lead to the war. This, in turn, would enable students to reflect upon themselves and overcome similar challenges in their lives. Afterall life is a series of clashing interests, and it has been that way throughout history. Another proverb goes: ""History repeats itself"". It is true only if we value the facts more than the ideas behind the events.
    Similarly, in maths, a student should be learning how to solve all problems of a certain type, as opposed to one specific setting. Once a student learns the fundemental approach to solving, then s/he may resolve any question of the similar type. Having studied maths, I believe I have a greater first hand experience with the latter example. The comprehension of concepts rather than pure learning of the facts is the mathematical philosophy. In any type of problem that maths deals with, the main aim is to deduce an overall solution for all problems of the same kind.
    Lastly, to conclude I would like to reestablish the importance of understanding ideas and concepts. Actually in schooling this indeed is the nuance. Learning at schools is more about the concepts than about the facts. When this occurs, the students realize the statement itself, and going back to my initial analogy, you make their life an ocean full of fish.

From the invention of the wheel, to the establishment of the trade routes via ships, transportation has come a long way and gained even more importance. In todays world, being able to travel freely is no longer a privilage, but a basic right for all human beings. And, we simply would not be able to fully appreciate this right, if we did not have cars.

Cars give us the ability to travel individually and freely, assuming that we can afford to buy one and operate it. They are essential for people who work, have families and have busy schedules. One must also remember that for some people, their cars are essential in their struggle to make a living. For instance people like taxi drivers and transporters rely on their cars. As a result I believe that no matter how well the public transportation gets, in the next twenty years or so, there will still be a demand for individually owned and operated cars. I belive that the need for cars will even be more significant with the expected increase in human population expected within the next two decades.

In todays modern world, twenty years is a long enough time for significant technological achievements to take place. As a result, I also believe that these achievements will have a remarkable impact for cars as well. I think cars will be a lot more different from what we have today. They are going to be more efficient, more cost effective, less polluting and safer to operate. Thus, more and more people would buy cars, or whatever replaces them, and as a result we will have more cars in the future.

../alldata/training/essays/1876159.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I strongly agree with the fact that successful people are avid risktakers.
 But first lets specify what success means?? 
Success not only means to be happy in terms of wealth, fame and appreciation, it also has a lot of bearing to self-satisfaction and the feeling of being at peace with oneself. 

Only if successful people cared about fame and money then I surely think that percentage of successful people living would have been far higher than it exists. The reason being there are defined and speculative ways for ganing wealth and fame or making pots of money. But for being successful in truest sense you have to be a risk taker. Not essentially in terms of an explorer amid the ghostly white setup of Artic in his mission to reach the pole, but also in terms of an individual whose philosophy involves inviting new ideas, redefining the conventions and more importantly unlearing the redundant practices. 
The people we today see enjoying corporate success, political success or even as movie stars have one thing in common. 
They dared to look beyond what was obvious. Then they took the next step or ""risk"" of questioning it and redefining it with a new startegy. Thus not only Warren Buffet, Fidel Castro and Robin Williams did that they changed the way people look at the usual and maybe mundane workings of earning profits, driving a nation and being an accomplished actor. 

This kind of reversal  and effective transition of the geography of tasks, work and assignments in to challenges and goals is what defines successful people from rest of the lot. I firmly believe that certain degree of non-conformity and questioning of dogmatic beliefs is also an ingredient to take your success to the next level. 

People would ridicule you, laugh at you or even hurl abuses at you but remember  companies like Apple Inc. weren't born out of cosy cushions of money and self apprasing practices. It grew rapidly due to creativity and innovative ideas which also involve considerable risk and questioning but payback is healthy and self satisfactory.

../alldata/training/essays/1985615.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than simply learning facts. However, sometime learning facts is necessary.
In the following paragraph i will state my reasons why i do agree with the statement.
First of all I think in today's society and business it is important to communicate. Discussing and talking about problems and ideas in a classroom gives you the ability to talk to people more easily even if you are not the same opinion. You learn to understand their idea and why they might think this specific way.
Another important thing is another benefit for your future job. Today you might be sitting in a classroom with a teacher helping you with every question you ask him or her but sooner or later you probably will be sitting in a business meeting, in a office or even be teaching a class full of students yourself. If you have learned to understand the ideas and concepts of things you also learned to solve problems. If you didn't understand it at first, you looked for answers and ways that you might be able to understand it.
The third thing is that it is probably easier to learn for a test when you get the main idea or the whole concept. When you prepare for a test and just learn facts the whole time but don't know how they fit together or what their connection is, it is pointless. You might know it untill the next day but you will forget it in about a month. However, if you learned the whole concept and understood it, you are familiar with it and it is easier for you to recall things. I would like to support my statement with an example: In Math it is very easy to solve problems after you have understood the main idea and the concept of the solution. Some tasks might be harder but you always know at least the way to solve them. If someone would just learn the formulars but doesn't know how to use them or how to combine them he won't do good on any test.
Even so I support the statement I have to say that there are some majors where learning facts is partly necessary. For example if you learn a new language you first just study the vocabulary.When you do history you have to learn dates and ""timetables"". In the end, however, it always matters that someone understands the whole idea.","I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than simply learning facts.

I certainly have no idea who came up with this particular phrase but I do percieve it to be very true and apt.

Limited knowledge of multiple topics is of no real use unless a person's vocation requires him to possess such knowledge. 
Specialization on the other hand is what leads to pure genius. Certainly some men are born a true genius. But others can get there through hard and consistent work in their particular field meaning specialization. To support my idea I put forward four exemplaries, Indian nuclear scientists - Dr. Homi Bhaba, Vikram Sarabhai, Raja Ramanna, Dr. Abdul Kalam. These men shaped Indian nuclear history. They absorbed nuclear science into their very blood and brought about a revolution in the nuclear field. India owes its present day nuclear status to these men who laid the foundation stone for the edifice of Indian Nucleardom. What would be our status today if these men settled for a broad outlook on general knowledge ?
But this is not to indicate that specialization makes every person reach the heights that these four have achieved.

If we, for example take a heart specialist or a engineer constructing houses, they cannot hope to execute their respective tasks without specialization in their fields.

I think the most comfortable one is the cars. I do not agree with the statement that ''In twenty years thre will be fewer cars in use than there are today'' because of the following reasons.
      First reason is that travelling by cars is the most comfortable way in short distances. In Turkey most of the people prefer their cars instead of puplic transpotation. We can understand this from the number of cars in the traffic. Especially the time that the people exit from their jobs, there is a traffic jam in everywhere and this indicates that people prefer travelling by car. So they cannot give up travelling by cars.
     Secondly, there are fewer cars in the past but this number is increased much more today. This shows that in the future this number will continue to increase. Maybe in the future the railway system will developed and be common but this will not prevent the use of cars.
     Third reason is that people's buying power increased according to the past and everyone can easily buy a car in Turkey. Furthermore, there is more than one car belong to a family. Since the railway system is not developed exactly and the fee of the tickets are not cheap to buy, it is cheaper to go to the short distances by car. Thus people prefers their cars.
     Finally, in the future cars will run with electricity or water or other cheap substances. Then therefore travelling by car will be the most preferable way of going to places in the following twenty years.

Firstly, trying new things and taking risks often leads people to see new opportunities. The technology and business are changing fast.

For example, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, took great risks when he decided to quit from university and start his own business. That was indeed a very brave and insightful choice for an undergraduate student to make. Because Bill Gates seized the new opportunity without hesitation, he gained great success. 
Noy only  can we have new opportunities by taking risks, there is also higher rate of return. When people only do what they already know how to do well, they have little room for improvement. Thus they cannot gain more for themselevs nor contribute more to the society.  In contrary, high risks often implys high rate of return.

../alldata/training/essays/395987.txt,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	",high,"I disagree with the statement. Lets guess what can be the possible reason or factors which can lead to fewer cars in future.

One reason may be that fossils fuels would be exhausted. Then there would be no way to run the cars, which may lead to decrease in their numbers. But scientists have estimated that there is enough fossil fuel for the next fifty years. So my guess is that cars number may go down but certainly not in the next twenty years.

One may argue the due to unforeseen reason the cost of fuel goes up. Even if that is the case, I hold to my claim that the number of cars running on the roads will not decrease. Because cost of everthing is related to the cost of petroleum fuel, directly or indirectly. On the whole the relative cost of the fuel will remain the same. There would be no reason to abandon your cars. 

Yes, there is a possibility that new transport vehicle comes into the picture in the coming years. But it would be expensive. All products in testing phase are expensive. The new products cannot reach to mass production stage in just twenty years. How many years do you think inventions like aeroplane, television, even the electric bulb took to come to a situation where they were mass produces. You have to build the entire architecture for that new product, which may take more time than the development of the product. Like to operate a  electric bulb  you need a fully functional electric network!

People are not going to dump their cars for a new product. This is especially true for the people in underdeveloped and developing people, where they don't throw away even non functional things! And these people constitute a majority when the whole world is considered. 

Also there is a reliability issue. The cars after serving decades are quite reliable. You have choices. There are motor cars. There are flashy royal cars like Mercedes. You have entire car sport based on them. People are not going to abondon them in such a short time. Though vehicles have replaced the use of animals like horses for transportation but there are still horse races. The number of horses has not come down. 

One may claim that people might become so serious about the pollution so they may stop using cars. They are not going to be serious unless it threatens their lives. And if the number of cars does not multiply beyond our imagination, there will not be a situation where car pollution would hurt us that much. The situation, I guess, will remain the pretty same.

It is possible that the world comes to an end. Or the whole world would be submerged in water. Thats a different issue. Assuming that life goes on as it is now and no such abnormal activity happens, I see no reason why the number of cars being used will come down.","I disagree with the statement.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"""Seize the day"" used to say the Epicurists, who else but young people would apply this moral point of view? Indeed I think that  young people do better know how to enjoy life than older people. There are several reasons for this belief.

      First of all I must acknowledege than the older people do, in one way, enjoy life for the simple reaon that their life is coming to its end. But, given that, I think that the young people live their life more intensively than their fathers or grand fathers do.
 
        Why do I say that? Because teenagers, and the young adults are eager to live their life, not only to live it in a normal way but to feel they are alive. They want to feel the life flowding in their veins. Thus they do crazy things thinking that they may be unable to do it afterwards. For instance young people are very fast drivers, very heavy drinkers, and very good at partying all night long. 

        Moereover, they don't only live more intensevely ""normal life"" but they are also looking for crazy things to do like jumping from an aircraft or jumping with an elastic from very high spots. I don't think that an eighty-years-old-grand mother would do that. Thus for two reasons. One is that she will be physically too old, an other one is that she will be mentally too old. At her age pleasures of life does not remain in risky things to do. She is just looking for some quiet stuff to make. But is she still enjoying life? She is certainly enjoying the end of it when young people are enjoying the dawn of it.

         That is the other main reason why young people are not only enjoying life but living it. It's because all opportunities are wide opened to them. A young mind is full of projects whereas an old one is full of memories. One is living things for real, an other is living them in fiction.


          All in all it appears that the young seize the day when the older look at it. But we can't deny them any pleasure for that. They are just saying ""carpe diem"" in a more peaceful way.","""Seize the day"" used to say the Epicurists, who else but young people would apply this moral point of view?

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I believe with the statement that ""Young peoples nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities"". Primary reasons for such attitude would be drastic change in their lifestyle, constant peer pressure, too much focus on shaping their own carrers and change in social values. I would take some of these issues to prove my stand. 

Young people are now under the effects of corporate culture everywhere. Whether this be their schoo, home or office .  This demands them to be at their best everytime. They are expected  to be first in their classes, decide startegies of business management, earn money. All these leads them to focus more on shaping their own identity and rather contributing towards their community. Young people put in much more efforts in terms of physical work then being put up by people of same age generations ago. This leaves them absolutely with no time for contributing towards their community. 

With such mad rush behind money, young people have become highly self-centric. They are not worried about suffering of their community, let alone doing something to remedify it. Young people with their living habits, social settings and behavior patterns likes to remain detached from everyone else. Leaving community, young people find it difficult to communicate with their parents and family members. This is not just because of communication gap but as well they are not concerned about their state.  In most of the cases they are non existent for them. With such apathetic attitude towards their parents, spending time for their community can be easily ruled out. 

Idea to help and connect is dying. A perfect example of this could be of how we like to make new friend through internet but young people are hardly aware of sufferings of r next door neighbour. Perhaps an example of apathy of young people towards their community can be best seen with recent Katrina hurricance in America. There were hardly any initiative being taken by any young people. Hence people do not give time to helping their communities.","I believe with the statement that ""Young peoples nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities"".

Secondly, adults often forget that young people have problems, and sometimes it is not minor problems. They can meet some difficulties at school. If children are not good students they might meet some difficulties to have friends or good relationship with their professors or even with their parents. Even worse, young people are used to face the violence. Parents and adults often bear in mind what was the school 20 years ago, that is to say safe and quiet. It is not the case todayany more.

The question whether in twenty years less cars will be used than nowadays is fairly hard to answer.
On the one hand I think this statement will become true for several reasons.
First of all gas prices are rising constantly for the last few years and this trend seems to continue. Therefore many people will not be able to keep their cars or at least reduce the distances they dirve to a minimum. Instead they will try to find alternatives such as taking the train or the bus.
Furthermore the reached level of pollution caused by cars is already very high nowadays.

On the other hand there are also reasons that support the idea that in the future the number of cars will not decline.
Allthough there will be more alternatives in the future to travel comfortably, made possible by for example new inventions like the transrapid, these inventions are still to expensive for most of the people. Therefore it will still be cheaper to go by car. The effect of the ricing prices in the energy sector on public transport media has to be considered as well.

Apart from that many people reject going by train or bus because they want to maintain their independancy. If you go by car you have no fixed times for leaving. You can just stay as long as you wish and do not have to care about the time
Moreover there are not direct connections available for all places to go. You might have to spend some extra time to reach your goal through changing the train or having to take routes for which you need more time.

Thus a person would find this more convinient and cant restrict himself from using his own car.

Thus i conclude that because of all the above mentioned reasons such convinience,reduced cost,etc the usage of cars will not be reduced.","I/PRP dont/VBP believe/VB that/IN in/IN twenty/CD years/NNS there/RB will/MD be/VB fewer/JJR cars/NNS in/IN use/NN than/IN there/EX are/VBP today/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP few/JJ reasons/NNS for/IN this/DT ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, in/IN todays/NNS world/NN transport/NN is/VBZ the/DT main/JJ important/JJ and/CC essential/JJ thing/NN ./.

People/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO go/VB in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ vehicles/NNS to/TO different/JJ places/NNS ./.

They/PRP are/VBP accustomed/VBN to/TO the/DT use/NN of/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ vehicles/NNS ./.

Very/RB few/JJ people/NNS use/VBP public/JJ transport/NN ./.

Almost/RB every/DT person/NN owns/VBZ a/DT car/NN ./.

They/PRP find/VBP this/DT convinient/NN ./.

Second/RB ,/, if/IN a/DT person/NN uses/VBZ his/PRP$ own/JJ car/NN ,/, he/PRP will/MD probably/RB reach/VB the/DT destination/NN in/IN less/JJR time/NN ./.

Thus/RB this/DT is/VBZ time/NN saving/NN and/CC every/DT person/NN wants/VBZ to/TO save/VB time/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, a/DT business/NN person/NN who/WP is/VBZ always/RB busy/JJ in/IN meetings/NNS has/VBZ to/TO attend/VB another/DT important/JJ meeting/NN in/IN just/RB few/JJ minutes/NNS at/IN some/DT other/JJ place/NN ,/, he/PRP finds/VBZ his/PRP$ car/NN more/RBR convinient/JJ than/IN any/DT other/JJ means/NNS of/IN transport/NN ./.

He/PRP just/RB reaches/VBZ the/DT destination/NN in/IN time/NN or/CC probably/RB earlier/RBR ./.

Such/JJ is/VBZ the/DT imporatance/NN of/IN car/NN to/TO a/DT person/NN ./.

So/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB possible/JJ for/IN such/JJ persons/NNS to/TO stop/VB using/VBG it/PRP ./.

Third/NNP ,/, the/DT person/NN is/VBZ free/JJ to/TO use/VB the/DT car/NN at/IN any/DT time/NN he/PRP wants/VBZ because/IN he/PRP owns/VBZ it/PRP ./.

Thus/RB this/DT gives/VBZ them/PRP more/RBR convinience/NN ./.

For/IN ex/FW ,/, a/DT person/NN wants/VBZ to/TO attend/VB a/DT party/NN in/IN the/DT afternoon/NN ,/, he/PRP can/MD reach/VB the/DT place/NN within/IN few/JJ minutes/NNS if/IN he/PRP uses/VBZ his/PRP$ own/JJ car/NN ./.

But/CC if/IN he/PRP relies/VBZ on/IN some/DT other/JJ means/NNS of/IN transport/NN -LRB-/-LRB- probably/RB public/JJ transport/NN which/WDT will/MD not/RB be/VB available/JJ at/IN our/PRP$ convinient/JJ times/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, he/PRP would/MD probably/RB reach/VB the/DT place/NN after/IN the/DT party/NN is/VBZ actually/RB over/IN ./.

Fourth/JJ ,/, since/IN the/DT technology/NN is/VBZ fast/JJ growing/VBG ,/, today/NN there/EX are/VBP a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN cars/NNS available/JJ ./.

Since/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT competetive/JJ market/NN ,/, the/DT cars/NNS are/VBP sold/VBN at/IN lower/JJR prices/NNS ./.

Its/PRP$ not/RB a/DT problem/NN for/IN a/DT person/NN to/TO buy/VB it/PRP ./.

Fifth/NNP ,/, there/EX are/VBP places/NNS which/WDT are/VBP accessible/JJ or/CC which/WDT makes/VBZ them/PRP easier/JJR to/TO reach/VB only/RB if/IN they/PRP go/VBP in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ vehicle/NN ./.

using/VBG a/DT car/NN also/RB prevents/VBZ the/DT person/NN from/IN being/VBG exposed/VBN to/TO hot/JJ sun/NN ,/, cold/JJ weather/NN and/CC rain/NN ./.

Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Many of us are eager to become successful people. However, many successful people did not magically succeed one day. They all took a risk of being a failure or overcame the struggles. Therefore, I agree that successful people try new things and take risks. 

For example, Bill Gates, one of the most successful businessmen in the world, did not even graduate from the university. His great invention, Windows was nothing but a program with simple design at that time. His courage and plan, however, was not simple nor easy at all. As if he needed to prove that he is a talented businessman, he had to visit numerous numbers of people to pursuade them that his invention is amusing. 

Additionally, Bill Gates did not always succeed. His business went through several hard times. His business went through several trials because people were jealous of him all the time. Once, he had to leave the company for dominating the market. This is very absurd in my opinion because if running the business really well is a problematic, how come many people are trying so hard to become a successful business man? 

Gate's another great invention, XBOX, shows another example. At that time, the future of XBOX was very unclear. The market was already being dominated by SONY's Playstation II. Plus, if XBOX had failed to success in the market, that would have been another life time crisis for BIll Gates. Bill Gates took the risk of selling ungaurenteed product to the market and thanks to his idea, XBOX almost dominated the market in the North America. Now, consumers can enjoy different kinds of machines.

To conclude, successful people cannot success without taking a risk of being a failure. However, it is not the luck or fortune that makes the sucessful person. It is the courage and careful plan that creates one succesful person. Hardly anyone seems to realize this and often blame God for not having enough luck!","Many of us are eager to become successful people.

As if he needed to prove that he is a talented businessman, he had to visit numerous numbers of people to pursuade them that his invention is amusing.

Additionally, Bill Gates did not always succeed.

His business went through several hard times.

His business went through several trials because people were jealous of him all the time.

Once, he had to leave the company for dominating the market.

This is very absurd in my opinion because if running the business really well is a problematic, how come many people are trying so hard to become a successful business man?

Gate's another great invention, XBOX, shows another example.

At that time, the future of XBOX was very unclear.

The market was already being dominated by SONY's Playstation II.

Plus, if XBOX had failed to success in the market, that would have been another life time crisis for BIll Gates.

Bill Gates took the risk of selling ungaurenteed product to the market and thanks to his idea, XBOX almost dominated the market in the North America.

Now, consumers can enjoy different kinds of machines.

To conclude, successful people cannot success without taking a risk of being a failure.

However, it is not the luck or fortune that makes the sucessful person.

It is the courage and careful plan that creates one succesful person.

Hardly anyone seems to realize this and often blame God for not having enough luck!","Many/JJ of/IN us/PRP are/VBP eager/JJ to/TO become/VB successful/JJ people/NNS ./.

../alldata/training/essays/913996.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I disagree with the prior statement for several reasons. When we say that is is better to do this or that, we should ask ourselves: better for whom? Is it better for me, for the others, for society as a whole? I think that altough a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be fruitful for individuals, societies rely more and more on specialized knowledge. And this is why i disagree with the statement. 
The first  argument is that if a society values knowledge, and ours does, then it should realize that the pursuit of knowledge is fostered by intense research in areas that become by necessity the object of further and further specialization. To increase our knowledge about things, be it nature, or the social realm, or just abstract math, we need researchers to constantly go beyond what they already know. It is only by being at the forefront of a given discipline that we can gain more knowledge about it. 
The second argument in support of specialized knowledge is that we, as a society - even though there are relevant exceptions-, do not pursue knowledge only for knowledge's sake. We use knowledge in order to satisfy an objective, be it the improvement of our societies, or of our health, or whatever it is we want to improve. Doctors want to heal people, engineers want to build bridges. Most of our society's needs depend on specialized knowledge. Broad knowledge of many subjects can serve the spirit, but the well-being of modern societies requires more than well-educated, well-rounded citizens.
Last but not least, our societies, which we value, as we have already said, need to be sustainable in the long term. Sustainability -economic, social, ecological- is a complex issue and we as a society need to educate people that should be able to treat this complex phenomena.
These are some of the reasons why we can say that specialized knowledge is better for our societies and therefore that is is better to have this kind of knowledge than having broad knowledge of many subjects. That said, individuals should be interested in areas in which they are not specialized, because thirst of knowledge is part of being human and it makes our societies richer in variety and more interesting.","I disagree with the prior statement for several reasons.

Who is successful nowadays? What does success mean to me?

Who is more successful, a person who takes risks or a person who does not?

In my opinion, if you are successful in your job, in your career, in you social life is because you have been developing some skills and situations that you already control and you know that they work. In my personal experience, I am a general dental practitioner, or a normal dentist. I know how to do my work in order to obtain good results. I would never try something new or risky in order to be more brave if I do not know for sure it will end successfully.

Those  who take risks to ""try"" to find success is because they have nothing to loose. 

For instance, imagine I had a business and for any reason it just failed. I would loose all my investment and I would be in bankrupcy. I have lost eveything. In this case if someone told me that he/she had an exeptional opportunity for me to start a business from the very beginning I would take the risk becuase I have nothing to loose.

Let's see another example in my professional life. A patient comes into my surgery complaining of pain in the central incisor. I take an x-ray and has a very big infection in the root. I have never done an apiceptomy (open the gum and cut the root) and I would never try to do one without the appropiate training as it can be dangerous for the patient. I would never take this risk to be successful in this case.

In sum, I completely disagree with the statement as I believe success is something you can find in your day by day life without taking any risk.  Look for it!","Find the success

Twenty years from now there will be more and more people coming to cities and towns in search of jobs and other requirements and population is increasing day by day. So after few years many people would require cars for their personal use. 
Now the number of cars are less becuase becuase big car companies donot go into remote places and villages to sell the cars as many people dont buy them. In future they might go into remote places in order to increase their sales. This is not possible today for many car companies because they dont have many funds to do provide cars and market them in villages.
Now a days there is only one car per family because only one person works in a family in India. In the future both wife and husband may work and both require cars. Needs of people are growing, people who own a two wheeler today want to shift to a car tomorrow.

Car companies are increasing their production day by day in order to get more profits and the company will prosper.  They are increasing their production seeing the increaing demand in the market.
