Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Personally, I agree with the statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 
However, I do not think that this statement is completely correct. I have to admit that there are several companies advertising their products in an honest way, stating only facts about the product without any misleading slogans or jingles.
On the other hand, the majority of today\s industries is clever enough to trick their customers into buying their products. They do so by either creating highly convincing advertisemetns with slogans or jingles people tend to associate with the product, or they claim characteristics and facts about the products that are simply untrue. The most effective advertising strategy next to an easy to remember jingle you cannot get out of your head  is advertising with the support of celebrities presenting the product. 
Even though I do not like the idea of being lied to by a company, I can certainly understand this marketing mentality that is so widely spread today. In a world of globalization, open borders and free markets, every market of every country is flooded with an increadibly high number of foreign products. Not only do foreign products mostly seem more attractive to customers, they are often  cheap copies of orginals invented and produced in the home country.  Monoplies hardly ever exist anymore and competing not only with other companies in the country but especially with foreign companies certainly is rough.

Being a customer myself, of course, I rely on the government to control marketing strategies on the one hand but I definitely rely on own experiences I make on the other hand.

Another factor that illustrates  the relative importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts is also evident from the rate at which facts are changing.

../alldata/training/essays/1174920.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,low,"In my opinion people always should try new things and take risks to improve themselves.If people stop themselves in front of the difficulties ,they never improve.
To become  successful people , we don't must do only what we can  do but, first of all in difficult situations ,we must take risks  even if they  should be wrong  at the end.
If we don't catch risks we never  obtein important results in every camp,for example 
For example if I want become a very important manager,in the world of work,I will have to take a lot of risks that regards my decisions.
This means that people that have important  ambitions can't limitate themselves in which they already know but they must search to improve themselves.
At the end I want say that don 't exist any person that became important limiting himself , but to become successful people  need courage and to take difficult choise to improve more and more.","In my opinion people always should try new things and take risks to improve themselves.

../alldata/training/essays/1223368.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Universities have considerably different educational systems. Some focus on providing students with theorical concepts and ideas, while other opted for practical learning methods. Both of these methods have advantages and I personally think that if a perfect educational system could exist then it should combine them.
	
	Theorical concepts are necessary for students. Indeed, they should help them to understand, model and simulate phenomena. No doubt they may complicated and perhaps boring to study, but students should pay attention to them and check wether they get them correctly or not.

	Nevertheless, practical activities are also required in teaching activities. In fact, they can help students to understand theorical concepts. Students will more likely understand a phenomena by a short experiment rather than by a long and perhaps boring lecture. They would understand it even better indeed.
Moreover students are generally more motivated to learn this way.
In addition students understand better when they do thing by themselves through practical projects and so on. In other words, they understand better what they discovered themselves than what they had been taught by others.

	In my school, I had both theorical teachings and practical teaching, and from my experiece I can say that combining these two methods in the right way is very fruitful for the students.

../alldata/training/essays/1239289.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,low,"It is believed that young people nowadays do not give enough time and response on their communities. I am agree with the statement, young people do not eve have enough time to interact with others.

People in the past liked to communicate with people, with their neighborhood, with family members,with students at school. Now it seems to me that they give more response to computers they have around, to i-pods they have in their pocktes and to any technology witch is facninating them. They dont have anough time for other things beacuse they just see the fact of 0's and 1's the same as the digital life, only true and false. So, there will be no other things around bothering them. Old man trying to cross the road, child running trough the car on the road, rubish trown on the road will not bother them at all because they have their own life, own world as tehy have nothing to share with others.

The real fact is that, no education supporting the idea that young people should pay more response to their community is made. Schools, goverment or families are also responsible. There might be a will of helping their communities on young people but i dont really see the act suppporting them. Eventhough they have an idea to do so, they are busy with school homeworks and projects more then helping tehir community.","It is believed that young people nowadays do not give enough time and response on their communities.

../alldata/training/essays/1365003.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I concede that in some respects, the young should contribute to their communities more in which they live in. However, beyond this concession, because of the new technology, the young are beginning to help their communities in some nations.Therefore, on balance, I do not agree with the statement.
     Admittedly, at a first glance, they do not give much time to help their community. This is especially true when it comes to developed countries. Compared with the decades ago, young people are required to study hard because they have to master more and more diverse skills including informaiton technology. In my observation, due to the time required to learn these skills, they do not have much enough time to contribute to their community.
     Nevetheless, the statement overlooks some positive changes that the young people have experienced. Thanks to the advent of the information technology, more and more young people help their communities using the technology. For example,  a number of young people used the technology to support humanitalian projects in many communities. The young in Japan supported the people who lost their houses because of a massive eathquake by calling for the financial support on the Internet. Thus, they can and do use the technology to solve local problems.
     It would be tempting to argue that the young are not interested in their community considering their apathy in politics in some nations. However, the statement overstates the situation of such nations. When it comes to nations where political situations are not stable, the young are forced to participate in their communities. For instance, we do not have to look no further than Taiwan. Because of their severe condition in which the pressure from Beijing is massive, the young are serious about their future and their nation. Thus, the statement unfairly ignores such young people. 
     In sum, because of their difficulties, many young people do not have much time to helping their communities; however, the advent of the informaiton technology made it possible for them to participate in the community in new ways. They are getting involved with their communities through these means.","I concede that in some respects, the young should contribute to their communities more in which they live in.

However, beyond this concession, because of the new technology, the young are beginning to help their communities in some nations.

Admittedly, at a first glance, they do not give much time to help their community.

This is especially true when it comes to developed countries.

Compared with the decades ago, young people are required to study hard because they have to master more and more diverse skills including informaiton technology.

In my observation, due to the time required to learn these skills, they do not have much enough time to contribute to their community.

Nevetheless, the statement overlooks some positive changes that the young people have experienced.

Thanks to the advent of the information technology, more and more young people help their communities using the technology.

For example,  a number of young people used the technology to support humanitalian projects in many communities.

The young in Japan supported the people who lost their houses because of a massive eathquake by calling for the financial support on the Internet.

Thus, they can and do use the technology to solve local problems.

It would be tempting to argue that the young are not interested in their community considering their apathy in politics in some nations.

../alldata/training/essays/1388870.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,low,"Some people want to try new things while other prefer to do the same that they knew all over their life.  I agree with the statement which says that successful people try to do new things even take risks rathre trying known things.  I agree becuse of severals resons.

     The frist reson is that  successful people shoud try to do new things otherwase they will not bring new things.  For example, the Neoten is well- known and pioneeir in this feild.  He looked to the apple which fall down from the tree as other but He looked to this case different from other and asked himself why did it fall.  As a result, he interdouced a new law of movement.
    Secondly, successful people take risk to do something new.  Forthat, although they will not get  benefit of all things, they can success in something new. 
     Thirdly,  successful people try to do new things with sometime high risk rathre trying known things. Becuse of high risk they can get high benefits and this according to the statment which says high risk gives sometime high rate.

../alldata/training/essays/1392946.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Nowadays a lot of people like to take riks and test their own limit. Everybode tries to hone their abillities. Some argue that this way of life is just limited to successful people, because they achieved nearly everything else . On the one hand, the successful people explore new things and have less concern about risks. But on the other hand, I think, that these features are not just traits of successful people, rather a typical human behavior like eating.
The need for certain risks, new expieriences and to be good at something is part of everyones way of life.

First, risks is often connected to the hormon adrenaline. If a person is in a dangerous situation his or her adrenaline level increases. This is often assiciated with a drug or the feeling to be alive. Successful people may have a greater need, because of their prior accomplishments, but this feeling and the hormon is common to every human being.

Second, the desire to try out new things and gain new expieriences is common to everyone. For examples, young children explore their surroundings and they find mostly great joy in it. This behaviour has obviously nothing to do with success.

Third, we live in a highly specialized world and nobody is able to be good at everything. Successful people, to my mind, have specialized in one trait to be successful. To learn another skill may lessen their ability to be good at their prime skill or at work. I study electrical engineering and i have to specialize to recieve an adequate education. Without the proper education I will not be able to find a job and because of this I will not be successful.

In conclusion, you can say that there may be a stronger appeal for successful people to experiment with new things, but the main ideas are merely human. The successful will not experiment extensively, because they will use the etch that made them successful.","Nowadays a lot of people like to take riks and test their own limit.

The/DT need/NN for/IN certain/JJ risks/NNS ,/, new/JJ expieriences/NNS and/CC to/TO be/VB good/JJ at/IN something/NN is/VBZ part/NN of/IN everyones/NNS way/NN of/IN life/NN ./.

First/RB ,/, risks/NNS is/VBZ often/RB connected/VBN to/TO the/DT hormon/NN adrenaline/NN ./.

If/IN a/DT person/NN is/VBZ in/IN a/DT dangerous/JJ situation/NN his/PRP$ or/CC her/PRP$ adrenaline/NN level/NN increases/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ often/RB assiciated/VBN with/IN a/DT drug/NN or/CC the/DT feeling/NN to/TO be/VB alive/JJ ./.

Successful/JJ people/NNS may/MD have/VB a/DT greater/JJR need/NN ,/, because/IN of/IN their/PRP$ prior/JJ accomplishments/NNS ,/, but/CC this/DT feeling/NN and/CC the/DT hormon/NN is/VBZ common/JJ to/TO every/DT human/JJ being/NN ./.

Second/RB ,/, the/DT desire/NN to/TO try/VB out/RP new/JJ things/NNS and/CC gain/VB new/JJ expieriences/NNS is/VBZ common/JJ to/TO everyone/NN ./.

For/IN examples/NNS ,/, young/JJ children/NNS explore/VBP their/PRP$ surroundings/NNS and/CC they/PRP find/VBP mostly/RB great/JJ joy/NN in/IN it/PRP ./.

This/DT behaviour/NN has/VBZ obviously/RB nothing/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN success/NN ./.

Third/NNP ,/, we/PRP live/VBP in/IN a/DT highly/RB specialized/JJ world/NN and/CC nobody/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO be/VB good/JJ at/IN everything/NN ./.

Successful/JJ people/NNS ,/, to/TO my/PRP$ mind/NN ,/, have/VBP specialized/VBN in/IN one/CD trait/NN to/TO be/VB successful/JJ ./.

To/TO learn/VB another/DT skill/NN may/MD lessen/VB their/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO be/VB good/JJ at/IN their/PRP$ prime/JJ skill/NN or/CC at/IN work/NN ./.

I/PRP study/VBP electrical/JJ engineering/NN and/CC i/FW have/VBP to/TO specialize/VB to/TO recieve/VB an/DT adequate/JJ education/NN ./.

Without/IN the/DT proper/JJ education/NN I/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO find/VB a/DT job/NN and/CC because/IN of/IN this/DT I/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB successful/JJ ./.

In/IN conclusion/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD say/VB that/IN there/EX may/MD be/VB a/DT stronger/JJR appeal/NN for/IN successful/JJ people/NNS to/TO experiment/NN with/IN new/JJ things/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT main/JJ ideas/NNS are/VBP merely/RB human/JJ ./.

../alldata/training/essays/1414676.txt,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	",high,"In my opinion the usage of cars will stay at a steady level, rather increase. Changes in propellants, road conditions, and a growing population can disagree in single points of views, but mostly suggest an increase in the number of cars.

Scientists, governments, and car manufacturers are in the process of developing and improving engines using alternative propellants. These propellants include gas, hydrogen, or electricity, but are not limited to those. This development can cause a smaller dependency on oil. If this is true twenty years from now, people might have switched to those alternative propellants and do not see the necessity to get rid of a car in general.

Arguments saying that the number of cars will decrease include facts like congested roads because of a growing population or a decreasing quality of road conditions. In addition some people claim and favor the usage of public transportation. I assume the behavior of people will not be changed in a recognizable amount. In a large city as I am living in both previously mentioned facts are true. Cars are though used in an increasing number. For many people the car still has more advantages than public transportation. As prices for public transportation also increase attitudes about this issue are unlikely to change twenty years from now.

As mentioned before, population is increasing. Personally I am familiar with the Orlando, FL area. Throughout the past five years an incredible extension of the metropolitan area could be observed. I suppose that an increasing population causes areas to grow - making distances longer. This again can probably not be compensated by public transportation. People will continue to use cars. As far as I have experienced people mostly favor individual transportation in their cars rather than in crouded buses and trains. I doubt a chance in the future.

Responses of urban and rural areas might also differ in response to this issue and must not be neglected. Generally I conclude a tendency to an increasing number of cars based on personal experience.","In my opinion the usage of cars will stay at a steady level, rather increase.

../alldata/training/essays/1431839.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I completely agree with the statement 'most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.' There are so many examples that prove this statement to be true.
	I am taking a psychology class at my school and we actually had an assignment about this. We had to bring an advertisement to class out of a magazine or newspaper that represents a product. Advertisements are always exaggerated to be better than they actually are. People advertise their products in order to sell it. It is a business and no business will be successful without positive feedback. Of course, if the product seems good, people are going to want to buy it. The advertisement that I brought into class was a cigarette ad. I found it on the back of a magazine lying around at school. The cigarette brand was ""Kool."" The ad showed a young man laughing and seeming happy. He was holding a trumpet trumpet in one hand while holding a cigarette in the other. This advertisement made cigarettes seem much better than they really are. Everyone knows that cigarettes are bad for your health and are in general just disgusting, but ads like these make people think twice.
	Another example of making products look better than they truely are, are food products. Many food companies that produce the same food as another company, will compete with that company. Both food companies will have to make their foods look better and sound better than that of the other company's. These advertisements will start popping up everywhere like on TV.  
	Advertisements like these are found everywhere you go. When you are at home, you will se advertisements on TV or receive it in the mail. When you are walking through the city, you will see posters hanging on the sides of the street or on the side of a bus. People cannot get away from it, which is good for the businesses, but bad for the people. People will automatically be attracted to certain products that seem very good on an advertisement.","I completely agree with the statement 'most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.'

It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,low,"I'm fully agreed that we should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in  one specfic subject . This is will grow up the knowledge and it will increase the educational part in the personality of the people . 

       For example , If you are invited in a converance that is talking about somthing that is not realted to your speciality . Then, you will be unable to talk and discuss any point that might be mentioned or raised  in the conversation . From my point of view , reading many books and articles that are not reated to one specific subject will help you to be more sophosticated person .  

    Another example , sometimes when you are specialized in one academic subject  such as Computer science and you read about other subject is not related to Computer science such as Math . You will see  in some points  there are some smiliraties   . As a result of this , the knowelge will be widly increased in the two subjects not only in one specific subject  .   

    Having a different career in the bacholer degree from the Master will also increase the knowldge and it will be better to have the bacholar speciality with the same master speciality .

../alldata/training/essays/1449555.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"The issue at hand is whether advertisements make products seem better than they really are or not. This is a very important issue, because advertisements have a great influence on our every day life.
In my opinion advertisments assume products to be better than they really are.

For this I have several reasons. The first is that I experienced how advertisements can lie in my own life. I saw a new hair shampoo at the TV, which should make my hair more shiny and easier to form. Because of this advertisment I went to the shop and bought the shampoo. Maybe my hair was shinier after using the shampoo, but it was not easy to model it at all. In reality it was even more difficult. This is one of the examples which made me casting doubt on advertisements. Now I always question what is shown.

Another reason is that I compare what I see in the advertisements with the things I can buy at the shops. Through this it is obvious that the advertisments are lies. Everything looks so colorful at the TV but in reality it is not colorful at all. It is just like every other product you can buy in the shop, which is not advertised.

Finally, one can sometimes see how advertisements are produced. That completely convinces one that advertisments make products seeming better than they are. Take for example some sort of food. When people want to advertise such products they have special strategies for it. The most interesting is that most times the food is not real. Advertisers just put it together with artificial materials. So it looks better and you just want to buy it. You will never find products in advertisments in their original way. That is a big lie to the customers, is it not?

To sum up, I think that advertisements make products better than they really are because of my own experience, compares between advertised products and the actual products in the shops  and because of the way advertisements are produced.","The issue at hand is whether advertisements make products seem better than they really are or not.

I/PRP saw/VBD a/DT new/JJ hair/NN shampoo/NN at/IN the/DT TV/NN ,/, which/WDT should/MD make/VB my/PRP$ hair/NN more/RBR shiny/JJ and/CC easier/JJR to/TO form/VB ./.

Because/IN of/IN this/DT advertisment/NN I/PRP went/VBD to/TO the/DT shop/NN and/CC bought/VBD the/DT shampoo/NN ./.

Maybe/RB my/PRP$ hair/NN was/VBD shinier/JJR after/IN using/VBG the/DT shampoo/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB easy/JJ to/TO model/VB it/PRP at/IN all/DT ./.

In/IN reality/NN it/PRP was/VBD even/RB more/RBR difficult/JJ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT examples/NNS which/WDT made/VBD me/PRP casting/VBG doubt/NN on/IN advertisements/NNS ./.

Now/RB I/PRP always/RB question/VBP what/WP is/VBZ shown/VBN ./.

Another/DT reason/NN is/VBZ that/IN I/PRP compare/VBP what/WP I/PRP see/VBP in/IN the/DT advertisements/NNS with/IN the/DT things/NNS I/PRP can/MD buy/VB at/IN the/DT shops/NNS ./.

Through/IN this/DT it/PRP is/VBZ obvious/JJ that/IN the/DT advertisments/NNS are/VBP lies/NNS ./.

Everything/NN looks/VBZ so/RB colorful/JJ at/IN the/DT TV/NN but/CC in/IN reality/NN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB colorful/JJ at/IN all/DT ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ just/RB like/IN every/DT other/JJ product/NN you/PRP can/MD buy/VB in/IN the/DT shop/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB advertised/VBN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, one/PRP can/MD sometimes/RB see/VB how/WRB advertisements/NNS are/VBP produced/VBN ./.

That/DT completely/RB convinces/VBZ one/CD that/WDT advertisments/NNS make/VBP products/NNS seeming/VBG better/JJR than/IN they/PRP are/VBP ./.

Take/VB for/IN example/NN some/DT sort/NN of/IN food/NN ./.

When/WRB people/NNS want/VBP to/TO advertise/VB such/JJ products/NNS they/PRP have/VBP special/JJ strategies/NNS for/IN it/PRP ./.

The/DT most/RBS interesting/JJ is/VBZ that/IN most/JJS times/NNS the/DT food/NN is/VBZ not/RB real/JJ ./.

Advertisers/NNS just/RB put/VBP it/PRP together/RB with/IN artificial/JJ materials/NNS ./.

So/IN it/PRP looks/VBZ better/JJR and/CC you/PRP just/RB want/VBP to/TO buy/VB it/PRP ./.

You/PRP will/MD never/RB find/VB products/NNS in/IN advertisments/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ original/JJ way/NN ./.

That/DT is/VBZ a/DT big/JJ lie/NN to/TO the/DT customers/NNS ,/, is/VBZ it/PRP not/RB ?/.

To/TO sum/VB up/RP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN advertisements/NNS make/VBP products/NNS better/JJR than/IN they/PRP really/RB are/VBP because/IN of/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ experience/NN ,/, compares/VBZ between/IN advertised/JJ products/NNS and/CC the/DT actual/JJ products/NNS in/IN the/DT shops/NNS and/CC because/IN of/IN the/DT way/NN advertisements/NNS are/VBP produced/VBN ./.","(ROOT

../alldata/training/essays/1453563.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"In a students' life, good learning is by studying from part to whole. This means that a student can do better if his basic knowledge of understanding is good. Learning facts is a part of study but one needs to deep knowledge to grasp facts and this comes by understanding ideas and concepts.

For example, a Biology student who is doing a research in the field of microrganisms can go ahead with his research only if he has the basic idea of microorganisms and their behaivour. By only learning facts, he cannot reach a final decision. To have his findings more a  solid basis, he needs to have a strong foothold in microorganic study.

Similar factors work with students who have just joined school or the ones who are in the process of a learning new subject. For instance, a mathematics student can do his high level arithmetic and algebra only if his lower level maths skills are developed. Furthermore, these skills become an inherent quality when he knows how to derive at a formula. Although learning a formula will make him work out easy problems but he will get stuck in the major issues.

In this sequence we can also come to a solution that understanding things is the key to success than merely knowing facts. A fact may help you out in the short run. It will not pave your path to reach your goal. A clear understanding develops interest in students to pursue their future in an innovative field of any branch instead of working on the set patterns by their ancestors. 

These criteria will also lead the world towards new technologies and sciences that are still undiscovered. Considering all the above facts I completely disagree to the fact that it is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to lern facts.","In a students' life, good learning is by studying from part to whole.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	",low,"Some people says that there will be fewer cars in feature.But I disagree with that oppinion I think there will be more car than there are today.
first,from the begining of car manifacture, the number of cars have been incresed.and there is no history that number of car is decreasd
that id first reason why i think number of car will not decrease.
secondly the affection of cars are increasing.todays when people go sonewhere they use car more than other public tranceportation.becuse going out by car is more convenions.and people want convenions more and more.
and their is no alternative to car.maybe you will say air craft,but there have to have to be wide land to aircraft to put on.but i think it will there will be less land in future than now.
another reason is that willbe more population in twenty years later than today.so as number of people grower,it will also grow number of car,people want.
and in twenty years,car  will develop more and more.and ability of human will grow.and if li that happen, gorvenment will lower the limitation of age,which people can drive.

../alldata/training/essays/1599482.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"To answer the question, if most advertisements make products much better than they really are I want to procide in a certain way.
Since the question states that not all advertisements, but most of them are making a product look much better than it really is, I am just going to give some examples in order to empiricly prove that the given statement is correct.
In that order my first example is the Mc Donalds french fries.
When you see their commercial on TV, where it is these tasty french fries just shouting out of that shimmering red box, they always look just fabulous. They are thick and have that perfect yellow-brownish color. And almost more important they lie in that box perfectly organized. Not a single one is misplaced.
Comparing that wounderful illusion of Mc Donalds french fries with the reallity one has to come to the conclusion that there is a gigantic diffrence between them. That example hereby strongly supports the given statement.
To give another example one just has to look at one of these energy drink advertisements. The advertisements tell you that by consuming that nice colored, always cooled looking drink all of your lost power or energy will be restored immediatly. Most of these advertisements also make one feel that one becomes more attracitve by drinking that baverrage.
As in the first example the advertisement gives one an image of the product which does not correspond to the reallity.
Altough I have to admit that I did not try every existing energy-drink I believe I can tell by the dozen I have tried that they are neighter as good looking, nor as good energy restoring as the advertisement wants to make one believe.
As these to examples perfectly show advertisements usually make a product seem much better than it really is, which is nothing to wonder about if one looks at the purpose of an advertisement.
Since advertisements are made to increase the number of sold units of a product, of course they try to make everyone believe that they are buying a perfect product.","To answer the question, if most advertisements make products much better than they really are I want to procide in a certain way.

../alldata/training/essays/162639.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"In my personal opinion, it is true that most of the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are mainly two reasons that accounts for this phenomena. One is that young people today concern more about their self-interests than the interests of the community. The onther reason is that yongsters today are more aloof with people around them. 
	Some adults blame the education, and some blame the society for the characteristics that young people bear nowadays. Adults believe these adolescents to be selfish and care only what they are interested in, and what will beneifit them most because our education do not emphasis on caring people and communities. Youngsters never show interest in helping their communities because they don't think they have anything to do with their communites. They don't believe that the community will do them any good or will benefit on them. Many have strong concept that if they spend time and get involve in  helping the communities, troubles will come. The more one involves, the more things waits you to help. And finally, your time is deprived and that your own work won't get done. 
	On the other hand, there's a weird notion which sometimes spread through television programs that makes young people feel more aloof with people around them. The reason is  that by showing much compassion and enthusiasm in helping the commuty may sometimes result in an unecessary troubles. There are many news broadcasts reporting that people get kidnapped or robbed when they are helping others to find way home, or helping those who pretend to be injured. These things happens so often that people are scared and unwilling to help others. Thus finally, people become more aloof with each other inorder to protect oneself from being harmed. 
	All in all, selfishness and coldness of the young people taday make them unwilling to devote themselves to public interests, like helping their communities. The fact is that community interests does not concern them, and they are afraid of being hurt. They don't want to devote on things that won't pay them back.

../alldata/training/essays/1693042.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people enjoy life more than older people do.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Young people enjoy life more than older people do. I am against this statement and have strong points to support myself. We read the newspapers and magazines and see that its only the young people dominating the front pages and party scenes. This creates a general misconception in people's minds that the youthful age is the age when life is meant to enjoy rather than when we're forty or fifty plus. We might think that this is true, but if we put ourselves in , say, our father's shoes. We conclude that life is all about going to work in the morning and coming back home tired. This isn't fun right? Well, now that a misconception. Older people attain enjoyment in places where we don't see anything but a boring event. Let me compare myself and my dad. I enjoy myself by going out to the movies with my friends etc., which I don't usually see my dad doing. Does that mean that my dad doesn't enjoy life? Wrong. My dad loves his work and takes pleasure in going to work everyday, and even on Sundays. He can't stand sitting home just lying in front of the television having pizzas and sundaes. That was supposed to be fun for me but for my dad, no! My dad really enjoys his early morning yoga sessions and tennis games, and really looks forward to them. To me these are nothing but time wasted which could be spent in sleeping, going out to parties etc. Whenever I take a close look at my dad I notice that he is really happy and enjoying life to the fullest while I'm not. 

Concluding, it all depends on the way we analyze the given statement. We may think we're the ones getting most out of our lives but no, older people also have a life and look forward to it more than we do.","Young people enjoy life more than older people do.

../alldata/training/essays/1723586.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"The issue of traveling with a tour guide is a controversial one. Some people find it to be beneficial, and more informative while others think that traveling on their own is more challenging.
I , however believe that traveling with a group guide is better. The reasons for my belief are the following:

First, traveling with a tour guide is more informative, since the guide has all the information about the place, and should be able to answer any question. He has also visited the place many times, and knows all the interesting places to be seen. I think that a person traveling with a tour guide will gain much more inforamtion and knowledge about a country's culture, than if he was to travel by himself. I have travelled with a tour guide once to Turkey, and although it was a tiring trip because the schedule was full, I got to know most of the turkish culture. One of the things I won't forget, is when we visited a play about the old traditional turkish wedding. It was a very interesting thing to see.

Second, the tour guide usually has a schedule for his group. In this schedule the group gets to see the most important, famous, and interesting places in the country being visited, probably a person visiting the country on his own would not have been aware of, or could not have planned such a schedule.  I find the time schedule to be my ultimate reason to choose a tour guide. Another reason, is the financial reason, usually tour guides have special deals with hotels or resturants since they bring them customers.

Third, I believe that traveling with a tour guide who knows the country, and traveling with a group of people is much safer than traveling alone. When visiting a new place, a person does not know the safe places, or what time is a good time to walk in a certain neighborhood. These details, which are of great importance, are taken care of by the tour guide.

For all of the reasons, I mentioned above I believe that it is a much safer, and more interesting experience to travel with a tour guide, if of course traveling to a country for the first time.","The issue of traveling with a tour guide is a controversial one.

../alldata/training/essays/1728162.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Swamped with commercials and advertisments in our daily lives, one might wonder whether a product's quality really correspond to the one being put forward by the ad or promotion. Although legally, companies can be held responsible for false advertisment, I believe that most of the sales and marketing campaigns for products do not reflect the real character of the product in question.

First of all, the praised outcomes of for instance cleaning products, can be questioned, as they deem to be very little effective for the actual purpose. Spot removal products are particularly known for this. Although  TV commercials highly recommend their use, real-life results tend to be rather frustrating. An ink spot or tomato sauce stain on your favorite yellow summer dress resists despite your desperate attempts of removing it with the highly suggested product. Unfortunately, one cannot blame the company, as the small print on the product usually allows for many loopholes regarding the interpretation of a product's effectiveness.

Furthermore, ad-campaigns, especially on TV or in the movie theatres, incite the viewers to step into a dreamland and do not reflect reality. By presenting a product, such as a Sports Utility Vehicule (SUV), as indestructable, indefeatable and magnificant, it may trigger hidden desires in potential customers. Yet, it is not important whether the product will be able to fulfill all the advertised qualities. In other words, the consumer, who will end up purchasing the item,  will most likely not need all the functions (e.g. four-wheeling) if the SUV is being used in an urban setting only. Nonetheless, it is important for the sake of the customer to maintain that dream alive.

Another argument, which supports my hypothesis is related to weight-watching products. It might be true that a person is able to lose a great amount of weight within the promoted time frame; however, this is rather a transient result. In fact, most of the time, customers who tried such products before, have found themselves with twice the weight they had before. Thus, the ad was only meant to effect short-term outcomes, rather than long-term related results.

In sum, the problem which advertisements are facing is a ""catch 22"". While they need to promote and even enhance the qualities and capacities of a product in order to incite consumers to buy it, they tend to exaggerate and paint an inaccurate picture of its real skills, which can lead to frustrating consumer experiences.","Swamped with commercials and advertisments in our daily lives, one might wonder whether a product's quality really correspond to the one being put forward by the ad or promotion.

Now i[m studyng MKTG. and I [m seeing this things. 
If you have a product is very iportant to have a bigest a great brand and advertising , because sometimes you have a product but  you go out aand oyou see that some enterprice have the same product and his product is much betta than yours. So you have to have a very good kind of Brand an also a great MKTG. tHE THING YOU SHOULD DO IS CREATEAN IMAGE TO RESPONSE TO THE OTHER ENTERPRISE and also you have to check a good quality of your product.

The most of the time the prodcuct that you have is not the best , but you can make the best if you have a great MKTG.
Lets thing about STARBUCS example, 
STTARBUCKS is not the bes coffe shop around the world but they are the number 1 why_

Now we can see when starbucks has not the grat coffe but the crate somethingto thepeople that name is NEEDS.

Also we can see with ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH here in Mexico.
We can not buy A AND F because we do not have a store.
Only the people can travel outside the  country .  And if the are a rich people can buy there. So this people came to Mexico and they bring this clothe and also if the sell some cloth3e areso expensive.

This is why I say that sometimes the MKTG is more important to sell one product..","Well I think this is a good thaught.

../alldata/training/essays/1827588.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I agree with the statement that the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I think trying new things would make people successful. This is because you can get to know more about different things and expand your views from many perspectives. Seeking more into one subject is a great thing, but trying to do new things would be more beneficial in the future. 
	By doing new things throughout your life can make them experienced. It's a wonderful thing to be an experienced person. By being an experienced person, people can solve more problems than those of the people who only know one thing and has interest in one thing. I think expanding your views and being experienced would lead you to gain reliance from people. Many people respect those of the people who have their own point of views and experiences. So by being the one who is respected, they would be surrounded by people who are respectful and reliable. 
	Taking risks rather than not will make that person's heart strong. I think to be an successful person, you would need to have some kind of risk. Larger the risk, the stronger  you'll be. It is because you cannot get stronger if you do not have courage to take the risk. It's is not the risk that is important. It is the courage that is important when you take the risk. It is hard to be courageous at first, however, after you have taken that risk, you would be very satisfied with what you have done.

../alldata/training/essays/1834502.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"There is a famous saying which reads: ""Give a hungry man a fish and he will be full for the day, give him a fishing rod and he will be full for the rest of his days."" I strongly agree with what the proverb says and furthermore I believe the same logic applies in this case, as well. The understanding of the ideas and concepts is just like the rod, whereas the facts are the fish that last only a day.
    I believe that an ideal education should equip students with the necessary techniques and concepts to tackle any problem as opposed to the specific solutions for the problems only covered in classes. This enables students to deal with a much wider array of problems as they learn a general recipe of problem solving compared to a case specific approach.
    One great example from contemporary education would be history classes. If facts were more important, then all a student would need to learn would be the years of certain events. However, I believe, and the statement asserts, that the motivations and consequences in a specific historic event should be studied more than the facts and dates. Rather than memorizing the year of a battle, an ideal history course should concentrate on the succession of the events that lead to the war. This, in turn, would enable students to reflect upon themselves and overcome similar challenges in their lives. Afterall life is a series of clashing interests, and it has been that way throughout history. Another proverb goes: ""History repeats itself"". It is true only if we value the facts more than the ideas behind the events.
    Similarly, in maths, a student should be learning how to solve all problems of a certain type, as opposed to one specific setting. Once a student learns the fundemental approach to solving, then s/he may resolve any question of the similar type. Having studied maths, I believe I have a greater first hand experience with the latter example. The comprehension of concepts rather than pure learning of the facts is the mathematical philosophy. In any type of problem that maths deals with, the main aim is to deduce an overall solution for all problems of the same kind.
    Lastly, to conclude I would like to reestablish the importance of understanding ideas and concepts. Actually in schooling this indeed is the nuance. Learning at schools is more about the concepts than about the facts. When this occurs, the students realize the statement itself, and going back to my initial analogy, you make their life an ocean full of fish. They try to learn something and anything, anywhere and anytime, because they have their rod.","There is a famous saying which reads: ""Give a hungry man a fish and he will be full for the day, give him a fishing rod and he will be full for the rest of his days.""

../alldata/training/essays/1851482.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,low,"During my life I made many social work to support my community.
I think  that I can disagree with the statement:""young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities"" because i'm a young person and i do its.
But I kown that  this statement is truth in many communities and in many group of young people.
Infact many young people don't make nothing to help or to support their communitie. This situation is because they don't feel part of their communities.For example if a young person changes his home many times he can't  feel a part of a community  and i understand that is difficul to help some unknown thing. also because if you don't know a thing you can't imaginate of what this thing need.
Sometime  young people are criticated by their communities and so it very difficult  that young people want help them.
Sometime young people have really too many things to do .For example school, sport, work.... and they have no time for social attivities.
I think that is very important for a young person make some thing for his community because in this way he can  feel able to help some one.","During my life I made many social work to support my community.

Cars give us the ability to travel individually and freely, assuming that we can afford to buy one and operate it. They are essential for people who work, have families and have busy schedules.

../alldata/training/essays/1876159.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I strongly agree with the fact that successful people are avid risktakers.
 But first lets specify what success means?? 
Success not only means to be happy in terms of wealth, fame and appreciation, it also has a lot of bearing to self-satisfaction and the feeling of being at peace with oneself. 

Only if successful people cared about fame and money then I surely think that percentage of successful people living would have been far higher than it exists. The reason being there are defined and speculative ways for ganing wealth and fame or making pots of money. But for being successful in truest sense you have to be a risk taker. Not essentially in terms of an explorer amid the ghostly white setup of Artic in his mission to reach the pole, but also in terms of an individual whose philosophy involves inviting new ideas, redefining the conventions and more importantly unlearing the redundant practices. 
The people we today see enjoying corporate success, political success or even as movie stars have one thing in common. 
They dared to look beyond what was obvious. Then they took the next step or ""risk"" of questioning it and redefining it with a new startegy. Thus not only Warren Buffet, Fidel Castro and Robin Williams did that they changed the way people look at the usual and maybe mundane workings of earning profits, driving a nation and being an accomplished actor. 

This kind of reversal  and effective transition of the geography of tasks, work and assignments in to challenges and goals is what defines successful people from rest of the lot. I firmly believe that certain degree of non-conformity and questioning of dogmatic beliefs is also an ingredient to take your success to the next level. 

People would ridicule you, laugh at you or even hurl abuses at you but remember  companies like Apple Inc. weren't born out of cosy cushions of money and self apprasing practices. It grew rapidly due to creativity and innovative ideas which also involve considerable risk and questioning but payback is healthy and self satisfactory.

To summarize the essay the society should be made of free thinkers and risk takers alongwith people who understand there vision, garner it  and substantiate it into a reality.","I strongly agree with the fact that successful people are avid risktakers.

If someone does n't know this fact in the end he is going to die just because he wants to know what will happen if he jumped but thats a far example because in our days this would never happen .

other thing is the fact that human ca n't just disappear .

But by studying concepts and ideas and doing tests .

You find that you can trick someone and you can not be seen if you walk slowly and walk in the dark parts without making noise .

Illusion too is that you use concepts that human mind ca n't explain so you trick people by doing that .

So in the end both concepts and facts are important .

But concepts are more important .","In/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD agree/VB with/IN the/DT statement/NN that/WDT says/VBZ ,/, ``/`` It/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR important/JJ for/IN students/NNS to/TO understand/VB ideas/NNS and/CC concepts/NNS than/IN it/PRP is/VBZ for/IN them/PRP to/TO learn/VB facts/NNS ./. ''/''

But/CC students/NNS have/VBP to/TO learn/VB both/CC concepts/NNS and/CC facts/NNS ./.

Then/RB they/PRP have/VBP to/TO compare/VB between/IN them/PRP and/CC decide/VB ./.

and/CC sometimes/RB facts/NNS change/VBP with/IN the/DT daily/JJ increase/NN in/IN science/NN feilds/NNS like/IN physics/NNS ./.

for/IN example/NN people/NNS used/VBN to/TO think/VB that/IN earth/NN is/VBZ like/IN the/DT sphere/NN then/RB it/PRP was/VBD found/VBN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB exactly/RB a/DT sphere/NN but/CC has/VBZ an/DT oval/JJ shape/NN ./.

And/CC facts/NNS too/RB that/IN dinasours/NNS were/VBD just/RB myth/NN till/IN they/PRP found/VBD the/DT bones/NNS of/IN real/JJ dinasours/NNS ./.

So/RB when/WRB a/DT student/NN understand/VBP cocepts/NNS and/CC ideas/NNS ,/, he/PRP can/MD think/VB and/CC used/VBD his/PRP$ brain/NN and/CC maybe/RB discover/VBP something/NN that/WDT can/MD change/VB facts/NNS ./.

But/CC this/DT still/RB does/VBZ n't/RB mean/VB that/IN they/PRP should/MD n't/RB learn/VB facts/NNS ./.

They/PRP have/VBP to/TO learn/VB facts/NNS but/CC concepts/NNS and/CC ideas/NNS are/VBP more/RBR important/JJ ./.

Lets/VBZ say/VB for/IN example/NN the/DT laws/NNS of/IN motion/NN they/PRP are/VBP concepts/NNS but/CC they/PRP were/VBD used/VBN in/IN may/MD discoveries/NNS after/IN that/DT ./.

why/WRB the/DT first/JJ fact/NN was/VBD that/IN when/WRB you/PRP throw/VBP an/DT apple/NN in/IN the/DT air/NN it/PRP falls/VBZ back/RB ./.

Therefore/RB facts/NNS are/VBP important/JJ but/CC concepts/NNS and/CC ideas/NNS are/VBP needed/VBN for/IN students/NNS and/CC well/RB after/IN that/DT scientists/NNS to/TO discover/VB things/NNS ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ sides/NNS facts/NNS are/VBP very/RB important/JJ too/RB ./.

For/IN example/NN the/DT fact/NN that/IN if/IN you/PRP jumped/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT window/NN of/IN the/DT 7th/JJ floor/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD die/VB ./.

If/IN someone/NN does/VBZ n't/RB know/VB this/DT fact/NN in/IN the/DT end/NN he/PRP is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO die/VB just/RB because/IN he/PRP wants/VBZ to/TO know/VB what/WP will/MD happen/VB if/IN he/PRP jumped/VBD but/CC thats/VBZ a/DT far/RB example/NN because/IN in/IN our/PRP$ days/NNS this/DT would/MD never/RB happen/VB ./.

other/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN human/JJ ca/MD n't/RB just/RB disappear/VB ./.

But/CC by/IN studying/VBG concepts/NNS and/CC ideas/NNS and/CC doing/VBG tests/NNS ./.

You/PRP find/VBP that/IN you/PRP can/MD trick/VB someone/NN and/CC you/PRP can/MD not/RB be/VB seen/VBN if/IN you/PRP walk/VBP slowly/RB and/CC walk/VB in/IN the/DT dark/JJ parts/NNS without/IN making/VBG noise/NN ./.

../alldata/training/essays/1985615.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than simply learning facts. However, sometime learning facts is necessary.
In the following paragraph i will state my reasons why i do agree with the statement.
First of all I think in today's society and business it is important to communicate. Discussing and talking about problems and ideas in a classroom gives you the ability to talk to people more easily even if you are not the same opinion. You learn to understand their idea and why they might think this specific way.
Another important thing is another benefit for your future job. Today you might be sitting in a classroom with a teacher helping you with every question you ask him or her but sooner or later you probably will be sitting in a business meeting, in a office or even be teaching a class full of students yourself. If you have learned to understand the ideas and concepts of things you also learned to solve problems. If you didn't understand it at first, you looked for answers and ways that you might be able to understand it.
The third thing is that it is probably easier to learn for a test when you get the main idea or the whole concept. When you prepare for a test and just learn facts the whole time but don't know how they fit together or what their connection is, it is pointless. You might know it untill the next day but you will forget it in about a month. However, if you learned the whole concept and understood it, you are familiar with it and it is easier for you to recall things. I would like to support my statement with an example: In Math it is very easy to solve problems after you have understood the main idea and the concept of the solution. Some tasks might be harder but you always know at least the way to solve them. If someone would just learn the formulars but doesn't know how to use them or how to combine them he won't do good on any test.
Even so I support the statement I have to say that there are some majors where learning facts is partly necessary. For example if you learn a new language you first just study the vocabulary.When you do history you have to learn dates and ""timetables"". In the end, however, it always matters that someone understands the whole idea.","I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than simply learning facts.

          first look for the past days,there man has less information to know,less luxiries,less work.there life can be lead comfortably with less money .that is why people  involve in the communitypart,especally students or young one, bcause life span is short.      
         then look for th present days here the information to know is vast ,so no time to diviate.now th world is in the hands of th people i.e every thing is available. as the human desire is vast.so he ends up in a wild goos change of things. no self satisfaction,so notime to look for the others.so he never bother about the surronding world.   
          second thing is the excessive growth of population.each city is having the lackhs of people, it may vary depend on the type of city is it metropolitan or capital city.depend on it the community sige varies. for the such large population.there are many problems and public can't solve iy as it requires more money. althogh collective impact may help,it is a difficult process. as every body looks for the govt help rather than hlping the society is the main route cause for the less involvement in the community work.shortly it is the increase in the population and work schedules of students leading to decrease in the involve of community work.

../alldata/training/essays/230893.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I disagree with the above statement for, simply put, it means ""Jack of all trades and master of none"". I certainly have no idea who came up with this particular phrase but I do percieve it to be very true and apt. A ""broad knowledge"" to my understanding may be defined as enough facts to project a scholarly image in refined society. In other words, claiming to have a read a book by reading its' back cover. Limited knowledge of multiple topics is of no real use unless a person's vocation requires him to possess such knowledge. 
Specialization on the other hand is what leads to pure genius. Certainly some men are born a true genius. But others can get there through hard and consistent work in their particular field meaning specialization. To support my idea I put forward four exemplaries, Indian nuclear scientists - Dr. Homi Bhaba, Vikram Sarabhai, Raja Ramanna, Dr. Abdul Kalam. These men shaped Indian nuclear history. They absorbed nuclear science into their very blood and brought about a revolution in the nuclear field. India owes its present day nuclear status to these men who laid the foundation stone for the edifice of Indian Nucleardom. What would be our status today if these men settled for a broad outlook on general knowledge ?
But this is not to indicate that specialization makes every person reach the heights that these four have achieved. But certainly an in-depth knowledge of any subject leaves the individual with a personal sense of satisfaction for actually having achieved a milestone and also brings him a respectful position in society where his achievement is appreciated by both his friends and others. If we, for example take a heart specialist or a engineer constructing houses, they cannot hope to execute their respective tasks without specialization in their fields. They touch the live of all the people they serve and in addition to their remuneration, they also earn the lasting gratitude of the people for a service well-rendered.","I disagree with the above statement for, simply put, it means ""Jack of all trades and master of none"".

../alldata/training/essays/232159.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"In my opinion today it is more important to specialize in one specific subject. Each field of science has developed very fast and branched out widely during the last 100 years. Today it is not even possible to have knowledge about each part of a scientific area. For example the area of physics can be devided into hundreds of different parts. There is the research of atomic behaviour in contrast to the research of forces that influence movements in our universe. Each new inventions that humanitiy makes becomes more and more complex so that even one single person can't undestand all of it. So it is important to specialize in one subject. 
On the other side a point for a broad knowledge is that all this specific knowledge has to be combined to become an efficient solution. By remaining in the scientific field of physics it can be mentioned that results that came up in atomic research have big influence to research on the whole universe. Thus there has to be a person who recognizes relationships between to diffrent areas of research. 
The problem occuring with this contradictionary ideas is that there has to be one part of people who have to specialize and another part that posses a broad knowledge to have an overview over all fields of researches.
So by choosing the major subject at a university it is evident that the student knows in which position he wants to work in his or her later life. Will he or she go very far into detail of a subject or more have an overview about a subject.
Thus at the end I have to conclude that there can't be a ""yes"" or ""no"" on the statement. It depends on what the person who has to decide likes better. Taking a job with caractaristics of leadership, then decide for broad knowledge. Choosing more scientific detailed work then it is better to have a specific knowledge.","In my opinion today it is more important to specialize in one specific subject.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	",high,"People go somewhere  every day in life. And they use trasportation vehicles in order to go to the place that they want. I think the most comfortable one is the cars. I do not agree with the statement that ''In twenty years thre will be fewer cars in use than there are today'' because of the following reasons.
      First reason is that travelling by cars is the most comfortable way in short distances. In Turkey most of the people prefer their cars instead of puplic transpotation. We can understand this from the number of cars in the traffic. Especially the time that the people exit from their jobs, there is a traffic jam in everywhere and this indicates that people prefer travelling by car. So they cannot give up travelling by cars.
     Secondly, there are fewer cars in the past but this number is increased much more today. This shows that in the future this number will continue to increase. Maybe in the future the railway system will developed and be common but this will not prevent the use of cars.
     Third reason is that people's buying power increased according to the past and everyone can easily buy a car in Turkey. Furthermore, there is more than one car belong to a family. Since the railway system is not developed exactly and the fee of the tickets are not cheap to buy, it is cheaper to go to the short distances by car. Thus people prefers their cars.
     Finally, in the future cars will run with electricity or water or other cheap substances. Then therefore travelling by car will be the most preferable way of going to places in the following twenty years.
     To sum up, there will be more cars in use than there are in the future because of the reasons that I have mentioned above.","People go somewhere  every day in life.

../alldata/training/essays/279212.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Poeple strive for success in many ways. Some  people specialize in what they already know how to do well. Others, however, are brave enough to try new things and take risks. Given the fact that we are living in a rapidly changing society, I agree that successful people are the latter ones who continuoulsy change their paths of life.
Firstly, trying new things and taking risks often leads people to see new opportunities. The technology and business are changing fast. If people stick to the old ways of thinking, they may be left behind by the society.  So we should be open-minded to the new environment. For example, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, took great risks when he decided to quit from university and start his own business. That was indeed a very brave and insightful choice for an undergraduate student to make. Because Bill Gates seized the new opportunity without hesitation, he gained great success. 
Noy only  can we have new opportunities by taking risks, there is also higher rate of return. When people only do what they already know how to do well, they have little room for improvement. Thus they cannot gain more for themselevs nor contribute more to the society.  In contrary, high risks often implys high rate of return. Those who try new things often get more because of the risks undertaken. My Marketing professor, for example, changed his career several times from amanager to aconsultant to a professor. He really gains much life experience and at the same time makes good fortune.
As stated above, trying new things and taking risks would bring people valuable opportunities and good return. We all live in a increasingly competitive society. That is why we should adapt to the changing world by changing ourselves. is exactly the way that leads to success.","Poeple strive for success in many ways.

../alldata/training/essays/302140.txt,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	",high,"I do not think that the number of cars will decline within the next twenty years for several reasons. There are big countries with growing populations which will have a huge demand for cars. Moreover, cars become even more affordable. The environmental problems which come along with the use of cars will be reduced, and alternative sources of energy will be found in order to satisfy the increasing demand. Thus, I do not agree with the thesis that fewer cars will be used in twenty years than there are today.

Big countries such as China or India have a huge demand for cars as their respective economies are growing and their inhabitants are becoming wealthier. Thus they will be able to afford buying cars. As cars are still perceived as symbols of power which represent a certain way of life, many individuals will acquire cars in order to demonstrate their new status. In addition, cars might contribute to the development of the large rural territories of those countries.

Moreover, cars will become even cheaper due to industrial and technological progress. Modern production plants provide much more efficacy than older ones did and require less ressources in order to produce cars. Thus, the average cost of cars will decline. Hence, it will be easier to sell cars even in underdeveloped regions.

Finally, many of the environmental problems that come along with the use of cars will be solved. There are already devices which effectively reduce the emissions of cars. Alternative sources of energy such as electricity or sustainable fuels will be found. That is, future cars will not have to rely on gas and oil. A lot of research is being done in this regard and has already yielded some encouraging results.

To sum it up,  there is a growing demand for cars. On the other hand, cars are becoming cheaper, and the environmental problems caused by cars will be reduced.

Moreover , developping countries , like China or India , are becoming huge customers of the car industry .

All this tend to say that the number of car will still grow for , at least , twenty years ...

But yet , some changes can be seen around the world : new types of cars are being created .

Thus , I think that the car will never desc : it is just going to evolve to meet our needs !

Cars will be running with new types of energies like hydrogen or solar energy .

They might become smaller that the cars we know , include an autopilot mode , have a totally different shape or even fly .

But still they will be cars !

The concept of car will never disappear because people need their independance , they need to feel free to go where ever they feel like and on their own .

This is to say that public transport wo n't ever outcome cars ...

So the car of the futur wo n't , probably , look like or even run like the ones we have now , it might be a plane , a car and a boat at the same time , but it will never disappear .

All this makes me think that saying the number of cars will decrease in a twenty years time is irrealistic .","A/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS are/VBP saying/VBG that/IN ,/, in/IN twenty/CD years/NNS ,/, cars/NNS might/MD start/VB disappearing/VBG slowly/RB ./.

../alldata/training/essays/339615.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,low,"I believed successful people are always try new things and take risk rater than only doing what they already know it. Somehow successful people are always try to create the new things to let them to be sussessful.

However, people didn't change jod too much once they were get used to on they own jod, so that is why people make different types money and how suessful their will be. Therefore, people were being successful it is because they knew how to change their life by change their own jod. Often people try to go to school like counmmitry college again, either by learn themself from book even they were elder adults. 
              In other way they might just by asked other people their own expenince make a ilttle change to fit in nowsday's socity. It usually makes them to be more postive to do it.

../alldata/training/essays/373416.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"A person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is able to understand people from all kinds of different academic fields, while a person who specialized in one specific subject is not able to. However, when a person who specialized in one specific subject is able to make it a profession, a person who just knows little bits and pieces about many subjects is not able to. In my opinion, this depends on what kind of future you are looking at. If you are trying to be a professional on a specific field, majoring in one specific subject might be more favorable. If you are looking at an adventurous life, you should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects.

	If you are not in a hurry about the future occupation or profession, you are likely to be better off having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than just one. You will be able to connect to all kinds of different people since you are able to understand them. Interacting with many different kinds of interesting people is a fairly attractive idea. For example, you are likely to come across many situations during your life where you get to talk to people in general, not just people in your own fieldt. Talking and making friends with different kinds of people will make your life more adventurous.
	
	However, if you are in a hurry to get a job, you are better off majoring in one specific subject.

Yes, it might be a little boring, but at least you will get to have a fairly organized, stable life.

Some people think, as young people are less aware of the seriousness of certain events, they can enjoy everything more than older people do. Other people oppose this point. As for me, I agree to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

	On the one hand, young people believe that older people can enjoy life more than they can. When I was a girl, I used to think that my parents and my grand parents are very lucky, because they didn't have homeworks, and could do whatever they want to do. I remember when I was 13 I said to my mom that I want to be 30 right now, because at this age, nothing were forbidden to me. I was so fed up to hear the adults saying ""You cannot do this, you are too young"" , or ""You cannot stay here, we are discussing about a subject that you cannot understand !!"" I was very upset, and thought that would be great to be older so that I can really enjoy life.

	However, I do not see it this way now. It seems to me that being young is synonym of being free, being independant. We can do whatever we want to without being always anxious.. Is that good? Am I suppose to do this? I really believe in the fact that, as young people are less aware of the seriousness of certain events, it is easier for them to enjoy life. 
	Moreover, since we are still young, we have everything to discover. It is great and amazing to discover some new country for example when we have the opportunity to travel, to learn different cultures from all around the world. 
	Furthermore, as we do not have children yet, we feel free to go out at night for parties, to do many things we won't be able to do in the future. Indeed, day after day, we would certainly feel bored to do always the same things, and we would not enjoy it likely.
	Last but not least, even if we have to study a lot, even if we have to work hard and may feel depressed time by time, I must recognise that it is even more interesting than staying at home everyday. It is more exciting to live without knowing what we will do tomorrow, than live everyday likely.

On the whole, I admit that I agree with the statement, because I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do as it is the first time they had discovered everything. Carpe Diem","It is generally believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

On/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN ,/, young/JJ people/NNS believe/VBP that/IN older/JJR people/NNS can/MD enjoy/VB life/NN more/JJR than/IN they/PRP can/MD ./.

../alldata/training/essays/395987.txt,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	",high,"I disagree with the statement. Lets guess what can be the possible reason or factors which can lead to fewer cars in future.

One reason may be that fossils fuels would be exhausted. Then there would be no way to run the cars, which may lead to decrease in their numbers. But scientists have estimated that there is enough fossil fuel for the next fifty years. So my guess is that cars number may go down but certainly not in the next twenty years.

One may argue the due to unforeseen reason the cost of fuel goes up. Even if that is the case, I hold to my claim that the number of cars running on the roads will not decrease. Because cost of everthing is related to the cost of petroleum fuel, directly or indirectly. On the whole the relative cost of the fuel will remain the same. There would be no reason to abandon your cars. 

Yes, there is a possibility that new transport vehicle comes into the picture in the coming years. But it would be expensive. All products in testing phase are expensive. The new products cannot reach to mass production stage in just twenty years. How many years do you think inventions like aeroplane, television, even the electric bulb took to come to a situation where they were mass produces. You have to build the entire architecture for that new product, which may take more time than the development of the product. Like to operate a  electric bulb  you need a fully functional electric network!

People are not going to dump their cars for a new product. This is especially true for the people in underdeveloped and developing people, where they don't throw away even non functional things! And these people constitute a majority when the whole world is considered. 

Also there is a reliability issue. The cars after serving decades are quite reliable. You have choices. There are motor cars. There are flashy royal cars like Mercedes. You have entire car sport based on them. People are not going to abondon them in such a short time. Though vehicles have replaced the use of animals like horses for transportation but there are still horse races. The number of horses has not come down. 

One may claim that people might become so serious about the pollution so they may stop using cars. They are not going to be serious unless it threatens their lives. And if the number of cars does not multiply beyond our imagination, there will not be a situation where car pollution would hurt us that much. The situation, I guess, will remain the pretty same.

It is possible that the world comes to an end. Or the whole world would be submerged in water. Thats a different issue. Assuming that life goes on as it is now and no such abnormal activity happens, I see no reason why the number of cars being used will come down.","I disagree with the statement.

Indeed I think that  young people do better know how to enjoy life than older people. There are several reasons for this belief.

      First of all I must acknowledege than the older people do, in one way, enjoy life for the simple reaon that their life is coming to its end. But, given that, I think that the young people live their life more intensively than their fathers or grand fathers do.
 
        Why do I say that? Because teenagers, and the young adults are eager to live their life, not only to live it in a normal way but to feel they are alive. They want to feel the life flowding in their veins. Thus they do crazy things thinking that they may be unable to do it afterwards. For instance young people are very fast drivers, very heavy drinkers, and very good at partying all night long. 

        Moereover, they don't only live more intensevely ""normal life"" but they are also looking for crazy things to do like jumping from an aircraft or jumping with an elastic from very high spots. I don't think that an eighty-years-old-grand mother would do that. Thus for two reasons. One is that she will be physically too old, an other one is that she will be mentally too old.

She is certainly enjoying the end of it when young people are enjoying the dawn of it.

         That is the other main reason why young people are not only enjoying life but living it. It's because all opportunities are wide opened to them. A young mind is full of projects whereas an old one is full of memories. One is living things for real, an other is living them in fiction.

../alldata/training/essays/449267.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,low,"I  agree that people right now do not give enough time to helping their communities.Because I think that I am a sush person , I realy do not give any time on my community .I  spent my time on school or shopping ,but no on my community.
The reasons that I think are many . The first reason is the most of people do not know how to help their community , that is true .Because in my contry , Taiwan ,we do have this habit to do social serve ,and no one teached us when we were kidds.For my example,
I live in a very big community . Since I living there ,no one had told me what i shoud do to this community , even my friends ,too.All we know when were kidds ,just play or go to school. Therefore , even I     want to do some for my community , but I realy do not know how to do .
The orther important  reason that I think is the people right now all focous on themself ,they realy do not think so much. The most of people nowdays , is too bisy to do the things they want to do ,they never do the things they do not like . Because I  know a lot this kind of people , they know how to play ,to shopping .But every time ,when school need us do some servies, they all run away.
These reasons is what i think.","I  agree that people right now do not give enough time to helping their communities.

../alldata/training/essays/450359.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,low,"Somebody sais: Young people nowadays don't give enough time to helping their communities. I agree with that for sure.
     First, young people always busy for their own business such as hand out with friends, spend few time to do the homework, spent time on the cell phone to know what happen with their friends today, watching TV and play video game etc. It's not kind of selfish but they just don't care about other thing which doesn't matter to them, for example, so something helping communities.
    Second, except young people don't want to spent time on helping communities. They don't understand why they have to, or what can they get from doing that thing.
    However, cause young people to don't care about too much thing it might because they don't ever know how is the feel to helping cimmunities and helping people also. They might would like to helping communites after they know that is more interesing than playing video games and talking on the cell phone.","Somebody sais: Young people nowadays don't give enough time to helping their communities.

../alldata/training/essays/535573.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Some people might believe that Learning the facts is more important to students. But personally I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Here are the reasons and examples from my experiences to support my opinion.
	First, I am thinkig about my mathematics class in high school. I learned many facts how to solve the problems.
My teacher just taught the method to solve the problem. We didn't focus much on the theory, which is origin of the solving method.
I was good at solving problems on exams, but now I forgot most of problem solving methods. I cannot apply to real life. I believe it is caused by learning just facts, not the whole ideas or concepts.
	Second, I want to talk about my design class at college.
Professor taught about wide variety of the ideas and concepts of the art history. And she gave the specific facts of each ideas and concepts. It is much easier to approach the class because we understand the ideas and concepts first, it helped a lot to understand each characteristics and facts. It also helped when I developed my design and portfolio. If I just learn how to make the portfolio with same way or how to sew my design just following the direction, How can it be different from others? 
	In conclusion, We should understand the ideas and concepts first. This is the way we can reapply the ideas and concepts to real life. If we just learn the facts, we cannot be  creative and reapply the ideas and concepts to the real life. I truly believe the statement that understand ideas and concepts is more important to students than learning facts.","Some people might believe that Learning the facts is more important to students.

../alldata/training/essays/594970.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"In general I agree with this statement. The task of education is to learn general skills, concepts and cultural abilities that can be useful in different situations.

We may use two kinds of examples to shed a light on this question. 
Firstly, let us use this comparison. If the mind is like a computer, we can say that the concepts are like the software and that the facts are like the informations processed by the software.

Secondly, we may analyse the case of history.

Furthermore, general historical concepts are very useful for the students. Without learning basic historical movements and periods, a student cannot remember so many historical facts.

As a general conclusion, we may say that, if the facts give the specifical informations on a topic, the concepts provide the general understanding.

../alldata/training/essays/609558.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I believe with the statement that ""Young peoples nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities"". Primary reasons for such attitude would be drastic change in their lifestyle, constant peer pressure, too much focus on shaping their own carrers and change in social values. I would take some of these issues to prove my stand. 

Young people are now under the effects of corporate culture everywhere. Whether this be their schoo, home or office .  This demands them to be at their best everytime. They are expected  to be first in their classes, decide startegies of business management, earn money. All these leads them to focus more on shaping their own identity and rather contributing towards their community. Young people put in much more efforts in terms of physical work then being put up by people of same age generations ago. This leaves them absolutely with no time for contributing towards their community. 

With such mad rush behind money, young people have become highly self-centric. They are not worried about suffering of their community, let alone doing something to remedify it. Young people with their living habits, social settings and behavior patterns likes to remain detached from everyone else. Leaving community, young people find it difficult to communicate with their parents and family members. This is not just because of communication gap but as well they are not concerned about their state.  In most of the cases they are non existent for them. With such apathetic attitude towards their parents, spending time for their community can be easily ruled out. 

Idea to help and connect is dying. A perfect example of this could be of how we like to make new friend through internet but young people are hardly aware of sufferings of r next door neighbour. Perhaps an example of apathy of young people towards their community can be best seen with recent Katrina hurricance in America. There were hardly any initiative being taken by any young people. Hence people do not give time to helping their communities.","I believe with the statement that ""Young peoples nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities"".

Primary reasons for such attitude would be drastic change in their lifestyle, constant peer pressure, too much focus on shaping their own carrers and change in social values.

../alldata/training/essays/618384.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"It is admitted that the optimization of already-gained competences lead to success.
There is indeed a high degree of certainty to reach goals,  achievement when using means that are already familiar and well  controlled.  
However, to me taking risks is a derterminant or aggregate to feeling and being more sucessful. I would even say that to me it represents the extra-mile.
From a personal experience, I was quite successful studying in France, in my mother-tong french. After a pre-degree I decided to take a major risk and instead of going abroad to pursue my studies for just one semester (as the big majority of students does), I opted for dual-degree program, where classes until the bachelor degree were delivered in German. At the time, my knowledge of German were not the best ever and it was difficult to follow in class. However, I gave myslef time to adapt, I worked hard enough, and after two years, I am fluent.  
It was a major risks, to compromete my good grades. Indeed it was logical that I would probably not achieve the same level of grades as in France. This was in fact a big deal, since i was planning on integrating school for masters, which for the selection require high grades. 
After weighting the pros ans the cons, on a long-term I came to the conclusion that this risk-taking experience had been one of the best decisions I ever made. I must insist on the fact, that at the beginning it had not been easy. However, through this experience, I had the opportunity to adapt to a unknown environment, culture and society, to learn i language and to improve my intercultural and interpersonal communication skills.

../alldata/training/essays/643139.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,low,"I disagree with the following statement which is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. The reasons are been shown next paragraghs.
    The first of all, leaning facts can halp students understand easily about what do they know the ideas and concepts. Because whatever how mach they understand ideas and concepts, but if they cannot ues thoes in the fact. The konwleage which is what do they get will be uesless. The most inportant is how to ues the ideas.
    The second, leaning facts derectly effect stendents to be successful easily when thay graduate from their schools. The raeson is more facts which they learned can help student to think a lot about the situations. From the facts which they learned, they could get the great ideas about how to conturl or hand out the fact which they encounters.
      Finally, learing facts can get more uesful ideas than the ideas which they understand and concepts from others. Becaues the ideas which the students understand and concepts from others are still others. I mean the ideas are not the students' experiences just ideas. But the facts which are all from the real situations are been uesd in the socirty.
      In the conlusion, i think the students learning facts are more uesful than understand ideas and concepts from others.","I disagree with the following statement which is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

../alldata/training/essays/67346.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Young people enjoy life more than older people do.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"For my part, I do not think that young people enjoy their life more than adults. I have in mind further reasons to explain that children or young people also have some problems. 

Fisrtly, I think this kind of statement is obviously done by an adult. Why? Because adults or old people have, must of the time, a certain nostalgy of their young years. I mean they tend to have better souvenirs than what really happenned in their life. The truth is not in the memories.

Secondly, adults often forget that young people have problems, and sometimes it is not minor problems. They can meet some difficulties at school. If children are not good students they might meet some difficulties to have friends or good relationship with their professors or even with their parents. Even worse, young people are used to face the violence. Parents and adults often bear in mind what was the school 20 years ago, that is to say safe and quiet. It is not the case todayany more. Children face racist and rude words from other students.

Thirdly, and it may be the main point, we need to wonder why when you are young you always want to be an adult. I remenber when I was ten or eleven, I wanted to be older to be allowed to watch TV in the evening or to be able to do everything I want to.  We have to bear in mind the childhood and the pre-adult steps are really very hard. Young people must build their own identity, but in the same time they are under influence. According to official figures, suicide is one the main death causes after car accidents. It shows how it is difficult to be young.

As a conclusion, it is obvious that yound people heve more leisure times and holidays than adults. But they also meet situation and problem to sort out. To be honest I think people are able to enjoy their like along their all life they just have to do the right choice, be happy or sad.","For my part, I do not think that young people enjoy their life more than adults.

../alldata/training/essays/711394.txt,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	",high,"The use of cars has increased rapidly over the last few years. Almost everybody uses his car daily for example to go to work.
The question whether in twenty years less cars will be used than nowadays is fairly hard to answer.
On the one hand I think this statement will become true for several reasons.
First of all gas prices are rising constantly for the last few years and this trend seems to continue. Therefore many people will not be able to keep their cars or at least reduce the distances they dirve to a minimum. Instead they will try to find alternatives such as taking the train or the bus.
Furthermore the reached level of pollution caused by cars is already very high nowadays. The governments will probably try to find solutions for this problem, which could be either higher taxes or to forbid driving to some kind of cars or even completely on some days in the year. If the first thing happens, having a car will again be more expensive and like this a lot of people will not be able to keep their cars. 
On the other hand there are also reasons that support the idea that in the future the number of cars will not decline.
Allthough there will be more alternatives in the future to travel comfortably, made possible by for example new inventions like the transrapid, these inventions are still to expensive for most of the people. Therefore it will still be cheaper to go by car. The effect of the ricing prices in the energy sector on public transport media has to be considered as well. Prices for using a bus or a train might become higher and the car could eventually still be the cheapest way to travel.
Apart from that many people reject going by train or bus because they want to maintain their independancy. If you go by car you have no fixed times for leaving. You can just stay as long as you wish and do not have to care about the time
Moreover there are not direct connections available for all places to go. You might have to spend some extra time to reach your goal through changing the train or having to take routes for which you need more time.

Taking all this into consideration I think that there will not be fewer cars in the future, because most people prefer going by car instead of using other transportation media.","The use of cars has increased rapidly over the last few years.

On the one hand I think this statement will become true for several reasons.

First of all gas prices are rising constantly for the last few years and this trend seems to continue.

Therefore many people will not be able to keep their cars or at least reduce the distances they dirve to a minimum.

Instead they will try to find alternatives such as taking the train or the bus.

Furthermore the reached level of pollution caused by cars is already very high nowadays.

The governments will probably try to find solutions for this problem, which could be either higher taxes or to forbid driving to some kind of cars or even completely on some days in the year.

If the first thing happens, having a car will again be more expensive and like this a lot of people will not be able to keep their cars.

On the other hand there are also reasons that support the idea that in the future the number of cars will not decline.

Allthough there will be more alternatives in the future to travel comfortably, made possible by for example new inventions like the transrapid, these inventions are still to expensive for most of the people.

Therefore it will still be cheaper to go by car.

The effect of the ricing prices in the energy sector on public transport media has to be considered as well.

Prices for using a bus or a train might become higher and the car could eventually still be the cheapest way to travel.

Apart from that many people reject going by train or bus because they want to maintain their independancy.

If you go by car you have no fixed times for leaving.

You can just stay as long as you wish and do not have to care about the time

Moreover there are not direct connections available for all places to go.

You might have to spend some extra time to reach your goal through changing the train or having to take routes for which you need more time.

Taking all this into consideration I think that there will not be fewer cars in the future, because most people prefer going by car instead of using other transportation media.","The use of cars has increased rapidly over the last few years .

../alldata/training/essays/71654.txt,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	",high,"I dont believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. There are few reasons for this.
                          Firstly,in todays world transport is the main important and essential thing. People are used to go in their own vehicles to different places. They are accustomed to the use of their own vehicles. Very few people use public transport. Almost every person owns a car. They find this convinient.
                         Second,if a person uses his own car,he will probably reach the destination in less time. Thus this is time saving and every person wants to save time. For example, a business person who is always busy in meetings has to attend another important meeting in just few minutes at some other place,he finds his car more convinient than any other means of transport. He just reaches the destination  in time or probably earlier. Such is the imporatance of car to a person. So it is not possible for such persons to stop using it.
                         Third,the person is free to use the car at any time he wants because he owns it. Thus this gives them more convinience.
For ex,a person wants to attend a party in the afternoon ,he can reach the place within  few minutes if he uses his own car. But if he relies on some other means of transport(probably public transport which will not be available at our convinient times),he would probably reach the place after the party is actually over.                            
                          Fourth,since the technology is fast growing ,today there are a wide variety of cars available. Since there is a competetive market, the cars are sold at lower prices. Its not a problem for a person to buy it.
                           Fifth,there are places which are accessible or which makes them easier to reach only if they go in their own vehicle. using a car also prevents the person from being exposed to hot sun,cold weather and rain. Thus a person would find this more convinient and cant restrict himself from using his own car. 
                       Thus i conclude that because of all the above mentioned reasons such convinience,reduced cost,etc the usage of cars will not be reduced.","I dont believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

There are few reasons for this.

Firstly,in todays world transport is the main important and essential thing.

People are used to go in their own vehicles to different places.

They are accustomed to the use of their own vehicles.

Very few people use public transport.

Almost every person owns a car.

They find this convinient.

Second,if a person uses his own car,he will probably reach the destination in less time.

Thus this is time saving and every person wants to save time.

For example, a business person who is always busy in meetings has to attend another important meeting in just few minutes at some other place,he finds his car more convinient than any other means of transport.

He just reaches the destination  in time or probably earlier.

Such is the imporatance of car to a person.

So it is not possible for such persons to stop using it.

Third,the person is free to use the car at any time he wants because he owns it.

Thus this gives them more convinience.

For ex,a person wants to attend a party in the afternoon ,he can reach the place within  few minutes if he uses his own car.

But if he relies on some other means of transport(probably public transport which will not be available at our convinient times),he would probably reach the place after the party is actually over.

Fourth,since the technology is fast growing ,today there are a wide variety of cars available.

Since there is a competetive market, the cars are sold at lower prices.

Its not a problem for a person to buy it.

Fifth,there are places which are accessible or which makes them easier to reach only if they go in their own vehicle.

using a car also prevents the person from being exposed to hot sun,cold weather and rain.

Thus a person would find this more convinient and cant restrict himself from using his own car.

There/EX are/VBP few/JJ reasons/NNS for/IN this/DT ./.

Firstly/RB ,/, in/IN todays/NNS world/NN transport/NN is/VBZ the/DT main/JJ important/JJ and/CC essential/JJ thing/NN ./.

Since/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT competetive/JJ market/NN ,/, the/DT cars/NNS are/VBP sold/VBN at/IN lower/JJR prices/NNS ./.

Facts are the best teacher that a person could have in his life. Concepts are good for the basic teaching but it is not useful in the real life. 

	Actions demostrate ten times more than a single concept. A good idea is the one that it is made a reality. For example, let's imagine that I am an engineer and I only know the concept to operate a machine. Can you imagine?

../alldata/training/essays/757891.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Many of us are eager to become successful people. However, many successful people did not magically succeed one day. They all took a risk of being a failure or overcame the struggles. Therefore, I agree that successful people try new things and take risks. 

For example, Bill Gates, one of the most successful businessmen in the world, did not even graduate from the university. His great invention, Windows was nothing but a program with simple design at that time. His courage and plan, however, was not simple nor easy at all. As if he needed to prove that he is a talented businessman, he had to visit numerous numbers of people to pursuade them that his invention is amusing. 

Additionally, Bill Gates did not always succeed. His business went through several hard times. His business went through several trials because people were jealous of him all the time. Once, he had to leave the company for dominating the market. This is very absurd in my opinion because if running the business really well is a problematic, how come many people are trying so hard to become a successful business man? 

Gate's another great invention, XBOX, shows another example. At that time, the future of XBOX was very unclear. The market was already being dominated by SONY's Playstation II. Plus, if XBOX had failed to success in the market, that would have been another life time crisis for BIll Gates. Bill Gates took the risk of selling ungaurenteed product to the market and thanks to his idea, XBOX almost dominated the market in the North America. Now, consumers can enjoy different kinds of machines.

To conclude, successful people cannot success without taking a risk of being a failure. However, it is not the luck or fortune that makes the sucessful person. It is the courage and careful plan that creates one succesful person. Hardly anyone seems to realize this and often blame God for not having enough luck!","Many of us are eager to become successful people.

../alldata/training/essays/832751.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Advertisements are everywhere.They can randomly get to you in a supermarket, in the streety, at your workplace or even in your car and in your home. Posters, television, radio, newspapers, and even the internet - all the mass media - are concerned, as most of them rely on advertisement to survive. There are so many ocasions to come across advertisements that it is even easy to let oneself be convinced and seduced by one of them.  Hasn't it happened to all of us? But what about the products themselves? Have you never ever been disappointed or felt betrayed by advertisements?

Over the last decade, advertisements professionals have developed an increasing number of sophisticated communication strategies to make the consumers buy their products. Advertisements make us laugh,they make us cry, and brands mark our mind and influence our judgment. Were we to listen to advertisers, all products would be of the best quality. It is true that consumers can sometimes be tricked into believing that a product is better than it really is, but the advertisement executives cannot really be blamed for it. 

Consumers play the game.Brands are signals to them, which they use to shop quicker and to which they are often faithful by principle. Consumers altogether also form a consumer society. These consumer society spread information and often condemn misleading advertisements and products, which quality is not what they expected. In short, consumers are an active alive community, which members communicate with each other.

../alldata/training/essays/844996.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I agree that that it is more difficult to assimilate an idea unless there is a good example to support it. In order to make them reachable, ideas and concepts should be followed by real facts taken from everyday's life experiences. 

To illustrate with an example, a concept such as 'freedom' has a very broad meaning and therefore it may be difficult to categorize and confine it with a few sentences. It should be presented with  examples from different places around the world, related to people with completely different cultural backgrounds. Important facts that changed the course of the history should be given. The first major movement that started in the name of freedom is the French Revolution. It changed the face of the world in a very positive way. This would be an excellent example to explain the fact that freedom is essential for anyone who wants to live his/her life proudly and respectfully. Everyone has a right to make his/her own decision and respect other people's decisions.  Also, one should have the freedom to express him/herself. There should be a tolerance and respect toward different opinions. Scientists, writers who are killed violently because of their opinion should be given as examples to illustrate the danger when one overtakes another's freedom of expression. With freedom comes another concept which is 'equality'. This idea can also be supported by many historical events that took place and still take place. People with different races, religion and culture should be treated equally. There should be no judgements on peoples' opinions based purely on which religion or culture they belong to. Unfortunately, even today, we see many examples of inequality. Every day newspapers are full of them, and I think a professor will have no difficulty to show students a few facts illustrating the examples of inequality.","I agree that that it is more difficult to assimilate an idea unless there is a good example to support it.

With freedom comes another concept which is 'equality'.

This idea can also be supported by many historical events that took place and still take place.

People with different races, religion and culture should be treated equally.

There should be no judgements on peoples' opinions based purely on which religion or culture they belong to.

Unfortunately, even today, we see many examples of inequality.

Every day newspapers are full of them, and I think a professor will have no difficulty to show students a few facts illustrating the examples of inequality.","I agree that that it is more difficult to assimilate an idea unless there is a good example to support it .

In order to make them reachable , ideas and concepts should be followed by real facts taken from everyday 's life experiences .

To illustrate with an example , a concept such as ` freedom ' has a very broad meaning and therefore it may be difficult to categorize and confine it with a few sentences .

It should be presented with examples from different places around the world , related to people with completely different cultural backgrounds .

Important facts that changed the course of the history should be given .

The first major movement that started in the name of freedom is the French Revolution .

It changed the face of the world in a very positive way .

This would be an excellent example to explain the fact that freedom is essential for anyone who wants to live his/her life proudly and respectfully .

Everyone has a right to make his/her own decision and respect other people 's decisions .

Also , one should have the freedom to express him/herself .

../alldata/training/essays/913996.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I disagree with the prior statement for several reasons. When we say that is is better to do this or that, we should ask ourselves: better for whom? Is it better for me, for the others, for society as a whole? I think that altough a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be fruitful for individuals, societies rely more and more on specialized knowledge. And this is why i disagree with the statement. 
The first  argument is that if a society values knowledge, and ours does, then it should realize that the pursuit of knowledge is fostered by intense research in areas that become by necessity the object of further and further specialization. To increase our knowledge about things, be it nature, or the social realm, or just abstract math, we need researchers to constantly go beyond what they already know. It is only by being at the forefront of a given discipline that we can gain more knowledge about it. 
The second argument in support of specialized knowledge is that we, as a society - even though there are relevant exceptions-, do not pursue knowledge only for knowledge's sake. We use knowledge in order to satisfy an objective, be it the improvement of our societies, or of our health, or whatever it is we want to improve. Doctors want to heal people, engineers want to build bridges. Most of our society's needs depend on specialized knowledge. Broad knowledge of many subjects can serve the spirit, but the well-being of modern societies requires more than well-educated, well-rounded citizens.
Last but not least, our societies, which we value, as we have already said, need to be sustainable in the long term. Sustainability -economic, social, ecological- is a complex issue and we as a society need to educate people that should be able to treat this complex phenomena.
These are some of the reasons why we can say that specialized knowledge is better for our societies and therefore that is is better to have this kind of knowledge than having broad knowledge of many subjects. That said, individuals should be interested in areas in which they are not specialized, because thirst of knowledge is part of being human and it makes our societies richer in variety and more interesting.","I disagree with the prior statement for several reasons.

../alldata/training/essays/937403.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Find the success

Who is successful nowadays? What does success mean to me?

Who is more successful, a person who takes risks or a person who does not?

In my opinion, if you are successful in your job, in your career, in you social life is because you have been developing some skills and situations that you already control and you know that they work. In my personal experience, I am a general dental practitioner, or a normal dentist. I know how to do my work in order to obtain good results. I would never try something new or risky in order to be more brave if I do not know for sure it will end successfully.

Those  who take risks to ""try"" to find success is because they have nothing to loose. 

For instance, imagine I had a business and for any reason it just failed. I would loose all my investment and I would be in bankrupcy. I have lost eveything. In this case if someone told me that he/she had an exeptional opportunity for me to start a business from the very beginning I would take the risk becuase I have nothing to loose.

Let's see another example in my professional life. A patient comes into my surgery complaining of pain in the central incisor. I take an x-ray and has a very big infection in the root. I have never done an apiceptomy (open the gum and cut the root) and I would never try to do one without the appropiate training as it can be dangerous for the patient. I would never take this risk to be successful in this case.

In sum, I completely disagree with the statement as I believe success is something you can find in your day by day life without taking any risk.  Look for it!","Find the success

../alldata/training/essays/990384.txt,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	",high,"I dont think that in twenty years ther will be fewer cars than now because sales of cars are increasing day by day. More people are using cars as it is easy to own a car today and many low cost cars are coming into the depending on demand of people ans usage.
Twenty years from now there will be more and more people coming to cities and towns in search of jobs and other requirements and population is increasing day by day. So after few years many people would require cars for their personal use. 
Now the number of cars are less becuase becuase big car companies donot go into remote places and villages to sell the cars as many people dont buy them. In future they might go into remote places in order to increase their sales. This is not possible today for many car companies because they dont have many funds to do provide cars and market them in villages.
Now a days there is only one car per family because only one person works in a family in India. In the future both wife and husband may work and both require cars. Needs of people are growing, people who own a two wheeler today want to shift to a car tomorrow.
Population is increains so to meet the increasing demand of the people more cars are manufactured so that every person can own a car and not depend on others. 
Car companies are increasing their production day by day in order to get more profits and the company will prosper.  They are increasing their production seeing the increaing demand in the market. Demand is increasing in the market as better roads are laid, better infrastructure is devloped and policies are made such that cost of the car comes down and even common man can own a car. These all reasons suggest that more and more cars will be used by people in the future.
Many banks and financial companies are bringing out plans so that it is easy for a person to earn a car. This plan will increase the number of cars on road as it is no longer a burden to own a car.
Due to advancement in technology new cars are coming with more latest features which makes a person's desire to eard a car. Growth in technology and ways of manufacturing cars are bringing out many cars which are advancement to their previous models. Through all this means it will increase the number of cars in the near future.
Before car was used as just a transportation mediun. Now it  is not like that as owning a car is a passion and even desire to some people. There were only few features in cars before but now a days the features in cars are multiple, with this you along with driving can do other work like listening to music relaxing and even office paper work as cars donot shake or give disturbace while driving.
Improvement in technology is making car driving easy and ride more and more comfortable.
So with all these reasons I dont think that number of cars after twenty years will come down but they will increase in number and increase in varities satisfying wide range of people using it.","I dont think that in twenty years ther will be fewer cars than now because sales of cars are increasing day by day.

Now it  is not like that as owning a car is a passion and even desire to some people.

There were only few features in cars before but now a days the features in cars are multiple, with this you along with driving can do other work like listening to music relaxing and even office paper work as cars donot shake or give disturbace while driving.

Improvement in technology is making car driving easy and ride more and more comfortable.

So with all these reasons I dont think that number of cars after twenty years will come down but they will increase in number and increase in varities satisfying wide range of people using it.","I dont think that in twenty years ther will be fewer cars than now because sales of cars are increasing day by day .

More people are using cars as it is easy to own a car today and many low cost cars are coming into the depending on demand of people ans usage .

Twenty years from now there will be more and more people coming to cities and towns in search of jobs and other requirements and population is increasing day by day .

So after few years many people would require cars for their personal use .

Now the number of cars are less becuase becuase big car companies donot go into remote places and villages to sell the cars as many people dont buy them .

In future they might go into remote places in order to increase their sales .

This is not possible today for many car companies because they dont have many funds to do provide cars and market them in villages .

Now a days there is only one car per family because only one person works in a family in India .

In the future both wife and husband may work and both require cars .

Needs of people are growing , people who own a two wheeler today want to shift to a car tomorrow .

Population is increains so to meet the increasing demand of the people more cars are manufactured so that every person can own a car and not depend on others .

Car companies are increasing their production day by day in order to get more profits and the company will prosper .

They are increasing their production seeing the increaing demand in the market .

Demand is increasing in the market as better roads are laid , better infrastructure is devloped and policies are made such that cost of the car comes down and even common man can own a car .

These all reasons suggest that more and more cars will be used by people in the future .

Many banks and financial companies are bringing out plans so that it is easy for a person to earn a car .

This plan will increase the number of cars on road as it is no longer a burden to own a car .

Due to advancement in technology new cars are coming with more latest features which makes a person 's desire to eard a car .

Growth in technology and ways of manufacturing cars are bringing out many cars which are advancement to their previous models .

Through all this means it will increase the number of cars in the near future .
